In this episode, you'll see an end-to-end view of streaming from the
broadcaster's point of view.  It's a tour but not an explanation or
tutorial.



## Who does what

We have certain role definitions:

- **Broadcaster**: Our term for the person who manages the streaming.
- **Director**: Person who is guiding the instructors to their
  sessions, changing the scenes, calling the breaks, etc.
  - Could be the same as broadcaster.
- **Instructor**: One who is teaching.  They don't have to know
  anything else about how streaming works.

This lesson describes what the Broadcaster/Director sees.


## Window layouts

What does the broadcaster see on their screen?

- What are the main windows you see?
- What do each of them do?
- Which ones do you need to focus on?
- How do you keep all this straight in your head?


## CodeRefinery control panel

- A custom application that controls scenes
- Based on OBS-websocket (remote control connection for OBS - we'll
  learn about this later)
- Can also work remotely, so that you can have a remote director


## How scenes are controlled

What has to be done during a course?

- How do you start the stream?
- How do you change the view?
- How do you adjust things based on what the instructors share?
- How do you coordinate with the instructors?
- How do you know when to change the view?


## Getting it set up

- How hard was it to figure this out?
- How hard is it to set it up for each new workshop?


## What can go wrong

- What's the worst that has happened?
- What if you need to walk away for a bit?
- Someone broadcasts something unexpectedly


## Alternatives

- Youtube vs Twitch
- Zoom stream directly to YouTube/Twitch
- Direct streaming platform, e.g. streamyard


## Q&A

Q&A from audience


:::{keypoints}
- The broadcaster's view shouldn't be so scary.
- There is a lot to manage, but each individual part isn't that hard.
