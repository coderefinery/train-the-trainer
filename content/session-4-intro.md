# Session 4 intro

This session covers streaming and technical production.  Some
introductory notes:

* (As of 2024) This is the first and only comprehensive introduction
  to our online streaming.
* These practices are new and well-refined internally, but a
  *different* kind of refinement is needed to teach and reuse them.
* The lessons have outlines of what to talk about, but it's just an
  outline.  It is *not* refined, since thees things are *new*.  Many
  things will have to be figured out as we talk.
* This session is a demo of lots of basics.
  * Ask questions - otherwise it will be boring
  * If you want to use this in real life: you will need *mentoring
    sessions* and active help.  Contact us to do that.

feedback.  Please be prepared.
