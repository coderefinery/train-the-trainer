Video editing
=============

Video recordings could be useful for people attending a course later,
but also are (perhaps more) useful for **immediate review and catching
up after missing a day in a workshop**.  For this, they need to be
released immediately, within a few hours of the workshop.
CodeRefinery can do this.

Summary
-------

* Basic principle: privacy is more important than any other factor.
  If we can't guarantee privacy, we can't release videos at all.

  - Disclaimers such as "if you don't want to appear in a recording,
    leave your video off and don't say anything", since a) accidents
    happen especially when coming back from breakout rooms.  b) it
    creates an incentive to not interact  or participate in the course.

* Livestreaming is important here: by separating the instruction from
  the audience audio/video, there is no privacy risk in the raw
  recording.  They could be released or shared unprocessed.
