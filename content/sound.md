## Tips for good sound quality

## Balancing and dynamic adjustment


## Exercises

:::{exercise} Sound-1: Evaluate sound quality
It's important to be able to discuss with others the quality of their
audio.  They can't hear themselves, after all.

- Within the teams, discuss each person's audio quality.  Be
  respectful and constructive.
- Consider, for example
  - Volume
  - Clarity
  - Background noise
  - Noise cancellation artifacts
  - "Ducking": first words at lower volume or missing
- Discuss how to bring this up during other courses and meetings.

:::{exercise} Sound-2: Adjust volume up and down
In addition to individual quality, it is important that sound is
balanced among all instructors.  Have you ever been to a event when
one person is too quiet and they can't make themselves any louder?

You should ensure that you have a the full dynamic range available to
you, and you know how to use it.  You might have to look into several
different locations in order to make the full adjustment ().

- Go to your sound settings
- One by one, each person
  - Adjusts their microphone volume so quiet that they can't be heard.
  - Adjusts their microphone volume so that it is extremely loud.

Once you know where these settings are, you won't be panicked when the
volume is too low or high during a course.

:::{exercise} Sound-3: Do a balance check
It's important that instructor audio is balanced (the same volume).
But how do you know?

- The leader decides the order ("I am first, then [name-1] and
  [name-2]")
- The leader says "one".  Everyone else says "one" in the order
  specified.
- The leader says "two".  Everyone else says "two" in the order.
- The leader asks for opinions on who they think is louder or softer.
  If there are more than three people, you can figure it out
  yourselves.  With less than two, you have to ask the audience.
