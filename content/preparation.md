# Pre-workshop preparation

These things will help you get the most out of this workshop, by
giving you a broad overview at the beginning that you might only get
later on in the lesson.

Don't worry if you don't have time to do everything here.  The most
important ones are listed first.



## Read "How to help someone use a computer" (5 min)

[How to help someone use a computer, by Phil
Agre](https://www.librarian.net/stax/4965/how-to-help-someone-use-a-computer-by-phil-agre/)

Summary:

* Most of our teaching challenge is helping people to overcome bad
  user interface design.



## Browse a CodeRefinery lesson (5 min)

Please take 5 minutes and go through a [CodeRefinery
lesson](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/) and understand the general
layout.  Don't go in-depth to any of the material (unless you want,
obviously).  We would recommend
[git-intro](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/) if you don't
have a preference.

Summary:

* Lessons are online and in free-flowing text form.



## (optional) Watch "The future of teaching" (35 min content only, 45 min with Q&A, or 15 min reading)

The "The Future of Teaching" talk is a summary of many things in this
course.  You could watch it as a preparation (or if you are reading on
your own, as a summary).  This is low priority, since we will cover
most of these things in the course itself.

* [Watch it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9Jor12Cxdc)
* or [read it](https://hackmd.io/KRqQirJ_Rn2SHcE-t1iAUg) if you prefer.


## (optional) Read "The science of learning" (20 min)

Read this short paper [The Science of
Learning](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf)
which provides a brief overview of some key evidence-based results in
teaching. This paper is also used by [The
Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) for their Instructor Training
workshops.
