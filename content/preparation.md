# Pre-workshop preparation

These things will help you get the most out of this workshop, by
giving you a broad overview at the beginning that you might only get
later on in the lesson.

Don't worry if you don't have time to do everything here.  The most
important ones are listed first.



## Pre-workshop survey (5 min)

## Watch "The future of teaching" (NN min content ontly, MM min with Q&A)

The "The Future of Teaching" talk is a summary of many things in this
course.  You could watch it as a preparation (or if you are reading on
your own, as a summary).  This is low priority, since we will cover
most of these things in the course itself.
