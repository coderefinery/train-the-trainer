# Streaming practice 1

This series of exercises introduces you to the practices of livestream
teaching.  It's nothing that radical, but since you don't directly see
the audience, you need to learn to interact with your co-instructor.

Basics:

* There are four role-playing scenarios.
* First, there is a demo and discussion together.
* First, go to breakout rooms to practice with a partner.  Practice
  with each person in each role.
* Then, we come back to the main room and see polished demos
  (hopefully from each group, but we'll see the time)


Not in scope (but you can practice here if you already know):
* Actual lesson content (use a lesson you already know or make up
  something that sounds good for the purposes of this lesson)
* Technical aspects of making a good screenshare and audio quality.
* Director and broadcaster related things.  But someone should
  pretend to be that for this session.



## Going live

You may think that starting a session isn't hard, and it isn't.  But
if it's extra smooth, it leaves a good impression.

The things you need to consider:
* Review notes and what needs to happen in the next session.
* Get everyone not active to turn off their videos
* Decide who speaks first
* Decide who does what over the next session
* **Give the most natural, motivating intro of the whole lesson,
  suitable for a wide audience.  It should set the expectations for
  what comes next**  Start with a minute or two of broad intro before
  getting into the actual technical topic.

The roles:
* Director: person pushing the buttons to go live (could be one of the
  speakers).  Counts down 3 [pushes "back"], 2, 1, [pause].
* Instructor A: speaks first and leads in to the main program.
  Engages instructor B.
* Instructor B: engages when it's time.


:::{info} The "going live" process with the director

* (Director: Announce it's almost time)
* (Director: asks everyone else in the call to turn off their videos.)
* Decide who is sharing screen
* Decide who is speaking first when you go live and what the first
  words will be.  (These first words are most important and you should
  think of what you'll say.)
* Director: In the director's panel, configure the "back to" setting,
  broadcaster audio, and jingle
* Director: countdowns "Starting in 3 2 1", (click the button),
  (everyone takes a breath for zero), then go.
* Speaker begins talking
* (Remember that each time you go back live is a good time to review
  the notes + answer questions)

:::{exercise} Going live
You will practice going live (but without the director part) in
breakout rooms.  In the main room, a few groups will demo and a
director will cue you to start.

* Break into groups of two
* Choose a lesson to start with.  For example (not limited to this):
  * https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/browsing/
  * https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/
* Practice giving the first two minutes of the lesson.  The emphasis
  is doing it several times to make it feel smooth.
* A good strategy:
  * Plan it all in advance
  * Decide who speaks first (A)
  * A starts speaking and asks a question of B to engage them.
  * Brief intro discussion before moving to the technical topics.
  Stop once you get to the technical topic.

## Doing a demo

Demos work great with co-teaching.  In this session, we will practice
the "talker/typer" system: the **talker** explains what is going on
while the **typer** does the typing.

Talker responsibilities:
* Manage the overall flow and timing.  They can keep an eye on the
  lesson and clock on their screen.
* Carefully say what the typer should do.  Describe it clearly, as if
  the typer was a student and didn't know the topic already.
* Can ask the typer "what do you think?" to keep a conversation going
* Can ask the typer "what should come next?" if they ever get 

Typer responsibilities:
* Does what the talker says (this slows things down and forces
  everything to be verbalized
* Should ask questions about confusing points or if the talker makes
  misses some steps that the learners need to hear.  This keeps a
  conversation going.
* Can jump in to remind the talker about what should go next, etc.

:::{exercise}
Practice doing a demo for 2-3 minutes.  You can't do much, but try to
at least:
* Divide to talker and typer
* Do the demo as listed above.
* Typer should ask at least one clarification of the talker
* Talker should ask at least one question to the typer.

## Q&A

Q&A is via the notes document, which can be just as or even more
powerful than a live Q&A.

Considerations:
* Screenshare the notes so that the audience can see what you are
  discussing.  (It's good to do this periodically even if there aren't
  questions, so people will know it's being monitored)
* Try to involve both co-instructors.  For example, one person can
  find an interesting question and first ask the other person what
  they think before giving their own answer.

::::{exercise} Notes Q&A
Divide into groups of **three** for this one.

The goal is to have two people discussing questions in a nodes
document while another is adding questions live.  (The third person
can also possibly be answering some of the question to simulate other
helpers).

Keep in mind that the answers to some questions can be "we will
discuss later".

If the exercise is done with the control panel: once the "Time" light
turns on, end the Q&A.

Sample questions to seed the notes with:

```
* Do I have to run `git add` before I run `git commit`?

* What happens if I make a commit wrong?

* How should I make a commit message?

* .

* .
```

## Saying bye

Going to a break/exercise isn't hard.  But, since there's no
opportunity to ask more questions, you should make sure that
everything is done.

Considerations:
* Someone will be waiting to switch the livestream to break mode.
  They can't read your mind, so **someone should say "bye"** to
  indicate it is done.  Then, the directory will immediately switch to
  break mode.
* Give a wrap-up of the session that is just ending, so that people
  can unpack.
* Give clear directions of what should be done next:
  * Do some exercise (state the goals which should be accomplished by
    the end), or
  * Take a break and don't forget to walk around some.
  * When to be back.
  * Update the notes with the info.

::::{exercise} Saying bye
Simulate a session ending according to the things above.  It's your
choice what session, but here are some suggestions:
* https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/commits/
* https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/test-design/
* Anything you have done

Try to include the following bits:
* Summarize what was just (pretended to be) learned
* Say what comes next (break or exercise)
* Some small interaction between co-instructors (asking each other a
  question)
* Whoever is talking least adds a description in the notes of what
  comes next.

Example notes description:
```
:::info
### Exercise Cloning until xx:12.
https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/local-workflow/#exercise

* Try to complete at least steps 1-7.  We will be using this in the next exercise.
