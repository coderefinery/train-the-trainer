# Livestream practice

This page contains various exercises to be done during

## Sound checks

Do the bottom two exercises from {doc}`sound`.  Audio quality and
balance is an important prerequisite for any teaching.


...
## Personal audio configuration

Purpose: verify that you have sufficient audio dynamic range

* Adjust your mic volume to very low (as heard by others)
* Adjust your mic volume to too high (as heard by others)
  * OS volume
  * Microphone position and physical volume
  * Application volume

If either end is inaccessible to you, we might have a case where there
isn't enough dynamic range to balance the instructors.


## Sound check

Purpose: learn the standard audio check and balance audio quickly.

- Pick a leader.
- The leader decides the order ("I am first, then [name-1] and
  [name-2]")
- The leader says "one".  Everyone else says "one" in the order
  specified.
- The leader says "two".  Everyone else says "two" in the order.
- The leader asks for opinions on who they think is louder or softer.
  If there are three or more people, you can figure it out
  yourselves.  With two or less, you have to ask someone in the
  audience.

Do this until it's fast and smooth.

## Screenshare check

Purpose: be able to share screen in a way that can be broadcasted.
Remember this size so that it can be set up quickly later - you'll
need to do this quickly, without hesitation, later on.

Background: most Zoom instances allow you to "share a portion of the
screen", which should be 840 wide Ã— 1080 tall.  This is rendered
pixel-perfect by YouTube and also forces a "small screen" so that you
don't share too much, and learners have space on their own screens.

:::{exercise} Demonstrate a proper screenshare

* Share your screen and adjust for portrait mode.
* If you can't share a portion of the screen, share your whole
  screen and tell the director what your total resolution is.
* Director: program in this as a named scene
* Instructor: Open the preview pane to see how it looks
* Instructor: make a note (tape on your screen?) to indicate the
  amount of space you have.

## Announciator panel

Purpose: Understand how non-verbal instructor feedback works.

* Open the announciator panel (Broadcaster will provide a link)
* Enable audio and disable SSL so that it works
* Director:
  * Explain the indicator buttons and what they mean.
  * Understand what effects these buttons have and when to use them.

Roleplay:

* An instructor is speaking without audio being on.



## Going live

Purpose: director learns to "herd the cats" into getting the stream started.

* Announce it's almost time
* Hide any other videos
* Decide who is sharing screen
* Decide who is speaking first when you go live and what the first
  words will be.
* Configure "back to", broadcaster audio, and jingle
* "Starting in 3 2 1"
* Say some words
* (Share notes and comment on )


## Introduce exercises

Purpose: Move to exercises in a controlled manner.

* Say what exercises are
  * What your goal is
  * How far you should get
  * Common things that might go wrong
* Add the exercise info + above questions to the notes
* Answer any questions from the notes (this )
* Verify that it is in the notes
* Leave to the break.


## Going to a break

* Look at the notes, anything to be answered?  (At least let people
  know it's in use)
* Say when we come back and what to expect then.
* Say "bye".
* Director pushes the "BEAK" button.
* Update the notes:
  * Break info block
  * When back
  * Exercise link (if any)
  * What the expectations are

## Notes fixup

Purpose: learn the common things that can go wrong in the notes and
fix them.


Fix up these notes:

* spacing is off (missing blank lines between questions, missing blank
  lines in bullet points)
* questions not answered
* Section headings at wrong levels
* exercises not described
* titles not there
* people answering above the exercise definition
* no template lines at the bottom.


Roleplay:
one person teaches, several people write badly in Notes, trainees have
to fix up in real time



## Lesson preparation

* Explain the point of a lesson in a few sentences
* Explain what you will not cover


## Lesson revision

* Revise this lesson to make it more usable for someone who doesn't
  know the command line (or is in some other way different from you).
