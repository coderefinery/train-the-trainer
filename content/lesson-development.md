# Backward lesson design (15min)

### Why "Backward"

The "natural" way to design a lesson, that people often default to, is
to write down material you want to cover and then springle in related
exercises. This approach has a couple of significant downsides:
 - The content feel meandering and it's unclear what is meant to be learned.
 - The exercises and exam may not test the intended learning outcomes.

In backward lesson design we start from the learning objective and the
"final exam" and work backwards from there to 

### The method:

 1. Understand you learners
 2. brainstorm rough ideas
 3. Start from learning objectives. Write down 1-3 overarching learning
   objectives for the lesson.
    - think of the things your learners will
      be able to do at the end of the lesson. Think simple! The simpler
      the better. Think of three main points they will remember, of which
      maybe one or two are a concrete skill.
 4. Write an summative assesment for each outcome. Try to think of engaging
    and active exercises.
 5. For a longer lesson, add intermediate goals and formative assesments
    to bridge between the starting point and the learning objective and put them
    in a reasonable order.
 6. Write just enough material to get from one assessment (exercise) to another.
 7. Describe the course so the learners know if it is relevant to them.

# Exercises:

## Lesson design exercise (10-20min, or longer)

 - Pick a lesson topic. Any of the Tools Workshop lessons are OK,
   or you can choose any other topic you might want to teach.
 - Write down three learning objectives. What abilities would you
   expect the student to have at the end of the lesson?
 - Brainstorm an exercise that demonstrates one of those objectives.
 - If you have time:
   - Create two more exercises
   - Write chapter headers for a quick structure


## Contributing exercies (10-20min)
 
 - Read an issue on a CodeRefinery lesson's GitHub page.
 - Brainstorm solutions. Write a comment in the issue.
