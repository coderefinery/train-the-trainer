Why teach together?
-------------------

It has been said **a lot**, especially in areas such as code development or scientific research, about the value of collaboration.
Yet still today, the effort of teaching is made alone far too often: a person decides to share their knowledge (or gets assigned a study module) and starts building the actual teaching material basically from scratch.
It seems much more logical, in the age of FAIR science and open knowledge, to release, develop, iterate, and maintain teaching material -- including the contact sessions -- **collaboratively** as well.

Ways to teach together
----------------------

* Develop materials together - avoid duplication.
* Present the materials together ("proper" co-teaching, see [Team teaching section](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/team-teaching/) on the CR manual).
* Use helpers extensively to tackle specific tasks commonly arising in online teaching process.
* Involve your learners too, e.g. using collaborative document (such as HackMD) for parallel and mass answers.

Advantages
----------

* If you need to teach anyway, combined efforts take up less time.
* More engaging to the audience, taking some of the (sometimes daunting) expectation to "speak up" off of the students.
* Easier on-boarding of new instructors -- one of them can be learning at the same time, either subtleties of the material or the teaching itself.
* [Swiss-cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_model) principle: two "imperfect" teachers are __much__ easier to find and complement each other than the extensively-prepared, absolute expert.

Challenges
----------

* Additional effort needed of teacher and/or helper coordination -- including syncing up their schedules!
* Materials might need to be (hopefully slightly) tuned to a specific target audience.
* Using simultaneous-teaching strategies is a learned skill, not identical to the classical lecturing.
* Online tools (HackMD, type-alongs) can potentially overload learners and teachers alike, if not used with care.
