## Share portrait layout instead of sharing entire screen when teaching online

- Many learners will have a smaller screen than you.
- You should plan for learners with **only one small screen**.
- A learner will **need to focus on both your screen share and their
  work**.
- Share a **portrait**/**vertical half of your screen** (840 Ã— 1080 is our standard and your
  maximum).
- Zoom provides a "Share a part of screen" that is good for this.

:::{figure} screenshare/landscape.png
:width: 80%

A FullHD 1920x1080 screen shared. Learners have to make this really small if
they want to have something else open.
:::

:::{figure} screenshare/portrait.png
:width: 45%

Portrait layout. Allows learners to have something else open in the other half.
:::

Motivation for portrait layout:
- This makes it easier for you to look at some other notes or to coordinate
  with other instructors at the same time
  without distracting with too much information.
- This makes it possible for participants to have something else open in the
  other screen half: terminal or browser or notebook.


### Instructor perspective

**I1**:
This is how it can look for the instructor. Zoom is sharing a portion of the left
side, the right side is free for following notes, chat, etc.
:::


### Learner perspective

Here are three examples of how it can look for the learner.

:::{figure} screenshare/learner-large.png
:width: 75%

**L1**:
Learner with a large screen, Zoom in dual-monitor mode so that the instructor
pictures are not shown. Screen-share is on the left side, collaborative notes
at bottom left, terminal and web browser on the right.
:::

:::{figure} screenshare/learner-normal.png

**L2**:
A learner with a single large screen (Zoom in "single monitor mode").
Instructor screen share at right, learner stuff at left.
:::

:::{figure} screenshare/learner-small.png
:width: 75%

**L3**:
A learner with a particularly small screen. Instructor screen-share at left,
your windows at right.

## Share the history of your commands

Even if you type slowly it is almost impossible to follow every command.  We
all get distracted or want to read up on something or while following a command
fails on the learner laptop while instructor gets no error.

**Add pauses** and **share the commands that you have typed** so that one can catch up.

Below are some examples (some more successful than others) of sharing history
of commands.

:::{figure} screenshare/history-portrait.png
:width: 50%

**H1**:
A vertical screen layout shared.  Note the extra shell history at the top.  The
web browser is at the bottom, because the Zoom toolbar can cover the bottom
bit.
:::

**H2**:
This isn't a screen-share from CodeRefinery, but may be instructive.  Note the
horizontal layout and shell history at the bottom right.
:::

:::{figure} screenshare/history-landscape-dark.png
:width: 75%

**H3**:
Similar to above, but dark. Includes contents on the right.
:::

:::{figure} screenshare/history-portrait-light.png
:width: 50%

**H4**:
Jupyter + terminal, including the ``fish`` shell and the terminal history.
:::

:::{figure} screenshare/history-portrait-dark.png
:width: 50%

**H5**:
Lesson + terminal, ``tmux`` plus terminal history and dark background.
:::

:::{figure} screenshare/portrait.png
:width: 50%

**H6**:
HPC Kickstart course.  Note the colors contrast of the windows and colors of
the prompt and text.  The history is smaller and doesn't take up primary
working space.  The working directory is in the window title bar.
:::

**H7**:
Show command history "picture-in-picture", in the same terminal window.

## How to configure history sharing

You need to find a way to show the recent commands you have entered, so that
learners can see the recent commands. Below are many solutions. Try them out
and see what works for you.

- [prompt-log](<https://github.com/rkdarst/prompt-log/>):
  It adds a interesting idea that the command you enter is in color and also
  provides terminal history before the command returns.

- **Simple**: The simple way is `PROMPT_COMMAND="history -a"` and then
  `tail -f -n0 ~/.bash_history`, but this doesn't capture ssh,
  sub-shells, and only shows the command after it is completed.

- **Better yet still simple**: Many Software Carpentry instructors use
  [this script](https://github.com/rgaiacs/swc-shell-split-window),
  which sets the prompt, splits the terminal window using tmux and displays command history
  in the upper panel. Requirement: [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)

- **Better (bash)**: This prints the output before the command is run,
  instead of after.  Tail with `tail -f ~/demos.out`.
  ```
  BASH_LOG=~/demos.out
  bash_log_commands () {
      # https://superuser.com/questions/175799
      [ -n "$COMP_LINE" ] && return  # do nothing if completing
      [[ "$PROMPT_COMMAND" =~ "$BASH_COMMAND" ]] && return # don't cause a preexec for $PROMPT_COMMAND
      local this_command=`HISTTIMEFORMAT= history 1 | sed -e "s/^[ ]*[0-9]*[ ]*//"`;
      echo "$this_command" >> "$BASH_LOG"
  }
  trap 'bash_log_commands' DEBUG
  ```

- **Better (zsh)**: This works like above, with zsh.  Tail with `tail -f
  ~/demos.out`.
  ```
  preexec() { echo $1 >> ~/demos.out }
  ```

- **Better (fish)**: This works like above, but for fish.  Tail with
  `tail -f ~/demos.out`.
  ```
  function cmd_log --on-event fish_preexec ; echo "$argv" >> ~/demos.out  ; end
  ```

- **Better (tmuxp)**: This will save some typing.
  [TmuxP](https://tmuxp.git-pull.com/) is a Python program (`pip install
  tmuxp`) that gives you programmable `tmux` sessions. One configuration that
  works (in this case for `fish` shell):
  ```yaml
  session_name: demo
  windows:
    - window_name: demo
      layout: main-horizontal
      options:
        main-pane-height: 7
      panes:
        - shell_command:
            - touch /tmp/demo.history
            - tail -f /tmp/demo.history
        - shell_command:
            - function cmd_log --on-event fish_preexec ; echo "$argv" >> /tmp/demo.history  ; end
  ```

- **Windows PowerShell**: In [Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/),
  a split can be made by pressing `CTRL+SHIFT+=`. Then, in one of the splits, the following
  PowerShell command will start tracking the shell history:
  ```
  Get-Content (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath -Wait
  ```
  Unfortunately, this only shows commands after they have been executed.

- [Tavatar: shell history mirroring teaching tool](https://github.com/Sabryr/Tavatar) can copy recent history to a remote server.

- [history-window](https://github.com/bast/history-window): Show command
  history "picture-in-picture" when teaching command line. Requires Bash.


## Font, colors, and prompt

### Terminal color schemes

- Dark text on light background, *not* dark theme.  Research and our
  experience says that dark-text-on-light is better in some cases and
  similar in others.
- You might want to make the background light grey, to avoid
  over-saturating people's eyes and provide some contrast to the pure
  white web browser.  (this was an accessibility recommendation when
  looking for ideal color schemes)
- Do you have any yellows or reds in your prompt or program outputs?
  Adjust colors if possible.


### Font size

- Font should be large (a separate history terminal can have a smaller
  font).
- Be prepared to resize the terminal and font as needed. Find out
  the keyboard shortcuts to do this since you will need it.


### Prompt

At the beginning of the workshop your goal is to have a shell
**as easy to follow as possible** and **as close to what learners will
see on their screens**:
- Your prompt should be minimal: few distractions, and not take up many
  columns of text.
- [prompt-log](<https://github.com/rkdarst/prompt-log/>) does
  this for you.
- The minimum to do is is `export PS1='\$ '`.
- Blank line between entries: `export PS1='\n\$ '`.
- Have a space after the `$` or `%` or whatever prompt character you
  use.
- Strongly consider the Bash shell. This is what most new people will
  use, and Bash will be less confusing to them.
- Eliminate menu bars and any other decoration that uses valuable
  screen space.
- Add colors only if it simplifies the reading of the prompt.

Later in the workshop or in more advanced lessons:
- Using other shells and being more adventurous is OK - learners will
  know what is essential to the terminal and what is extra for your
  environment.

Try to find a good balance between:
- Showing a simple setup and showing a more realistic setup.
- Showing a consistent setup among all instructors and showing a
  variety of setups.


## Habits we need to un-learn

- **Do not clear the terminal**. Un-learn CTRL-L or `clear` if possible.
  More people will wonder what
  just got lost than are helped by seeing a blank screen.  Push
  ``ENTER`` a few times instead to add some white space.
- **Do not rapidly switch between windows** or navigate quickly between multiple
  terminals, browser tabs, etc. This is useful during your own work when nobody
  is watching, but it is very hard to follow for learners.
- Avoid using **aliases** or **shortcuts** that are not part of the
  standard setup. Learners probably don't have them, and they will fail
  if they try to follow your typing. Consider even to rename corresponding
  files (`.bashrc`, `.gitconfig`, `.ssh/config`, `.ssh/authorized_keys`, `.conda/*`).
- Be careful about using **tab completion** or **reverse history search** if these
  haven't been introduced yet.


## Desktop environment and browser

- Try to remove window title bars if they take up lots of space
  without adding value to the learner.
- Can you easily resize your windows for adjusting during teaching?
- Does your web browser have a way to reduce its menu bars and other
  decoration size?
  - Firefox-based browsers: go to `about:config` and set
    `layout.css.devPixelsPerPx` to a value slightly smaller than one,
    like `0.75`.  Be careful you don't set it too small or large since
    it might be hard to recover!  When you set it to something smaller
    than 1, all window decorations become smaller, and you compensate
    by zooming in on the website more (you can set the default zoom to
    be greater than 100% to compensate).  Overall, you get more
    information and less distraction.


## How to switch between teaching setup and work setup?

- Make a dedicated "demos" profile in your terminal emulator, if
  relevant.  Or use a different terminal emulator just for demos.
- Same idea for the browser: Consider using a different browser profile for
  teaching/demos.
- Another idea is to containerize the setup for teaching.
  We might demonstrate this during the {ref}`cool-gems` session later.

:::{keypoints}
- Share **portrait layout** instead of sharing entire screen
- **Adjust your prompt** to make commands easy to read
- **Readability** and beauty is important: adjust your setup for your audience
- **Share the history** of your commands
- Get set up a **few days in advance** and get feedback from someone else.
  Feedback and time to improve is very important to make things clear and accessible.
  10 minutes before the session starts is typically too late.
