# Train the trainer workshop

::::{admonition} August/September 2024 CodeRefinery train the trainer workshop

Do you teach the use of computers and computational tools? Are you curious about scaling your training and learn about tested and proven practices from CodeRefinery workshops and other trainers? Join us for the CodeRefinery train the trainer workshop: four self-contained sessions on tools and techniques for computational training offer a great chance to enhance your teaching skills and learn about new tools and practices.
