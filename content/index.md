# Train the trainer workshop

::::{admonition} August/September 2024 CodeRefinery train the trainer workshop

Do you teach the use of computers and computational tools? Are you curious about scaling your training and learn about tested and proven practices from CodeRefinery workshops and other trainers? Join us for the CodeRefinery train the trainer workshop: four self-contained sessions on tools and techniques for computational training offer a great chance to enhance your teaching skills and learn about new tools and practices. What you will learn is also used a lot outside CodeRefinery, whenever good beginner friendly training is needed.

**Learning objectives:**
- Learn about tools and techniques and practice to create engaging online teaching experiences (screenshare, audio, etc.).
- Become mentally ready to be an instructor in a collaborative interactive online workshop (not only large workshops but in general).
- Learn how to design and develop lesson material collaboratively.

**Target audience:**
- Everyone teaching online workshops about computational topics or interested in teaching.
- Previous and future instructors and helpers of CodeRefinery workshops.

**Prerequisites:**
An interest in teaching.

**Workshop structure:** 
We aim for a mix of modular presentations and work in small groups. The latter will be done in breakoutrooms - 
be prepared to switch on your camera and have a fruitful exchange with fellow participants!
