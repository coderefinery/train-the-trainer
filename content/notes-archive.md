##### About teaching

What is the hardest thing about teaching for you?
- Knowing how "it's going", whether learners are happy or not (especially when teaching online) :+1:
- The preparation the night before.  It is always much more that I would hope, no matter how prepared I want it to be :+1: :+1:
- Managing groups with vastly different academic backgrounds
- Teaching wide spectrum of skill level at the same time. :+1: :+1: :+1: :+1:
- Time management! (Knowing how much can fit in a sessions) :+1: :+1: 
- General preparation time, how to fit it into the regular work schedule, and estimate how much time is needed for prep.
- How to reduce too much text into just the right amount
- Preparation of the session material and estimating the right amount of time for each section
- Getting learners to take the first step: sign up for and attend a workshop, when they don't think programming is a skill they can learn
- Getting learners to take the _second_ step: translating what they've learned in a workshop into something they can apply 
- preparation and time management
- Engaging with the students which was much easier for me when I used to coach
- Finding the right depth for an unknown audience for "my topic"
- education background of participants and their learning objectives

What is the best thing about teaching for you?
- Seeing when learner gets interested/curious about something and takes inspiration from the course. :+1:
- Seeing it works and someone can do something new.
- Motivated students grasping new stuff
- Students picking up and running with the matertial and skills I give them and using it for their own work. :+1:
- The "ah-ha!" moment when a student gets it! :+1::100: :+1:
- Learning from students who know about some topic more than you do. :+1:
- Being able to help people reach their goals, by showing them something new.
- Teaching is optimism acted out in the hope of making a difference both ways I suppose.
- The feeling of accomplishment when you see learning grow and implement the learnings :book: 
- mutual learning and impact on learners :+1:
- Results and feedbacks / Mutual interests and interesting discussions
- mutual learning and I can also learn lots of things and new ideas from participants


#### :question: Questions 

##### General / Practicalities

- Will the material be made available?
    - Materials are and will stay available at https://coderefinery.github.io/train-the-trainer/
        - Can I share them with a colleague
            - Yes please :) 
        - Can I resuse them in my own teaching?
            - Yes please :)
- Will these sessions be recorded?
    - No, but the materials (see above) should include everything needed for self-learning.
- Can I get a certificate for this workshop?
    - You can get a certificate of attendance after the workshop by sending an e-mail to support@coderefinery.org, telling us a bit about what you have learned and which sessions you attended.
- How often will we be talking in breakout rooms? I'm not in a place where I can talk, so if we're going to talk a lot I'll need to move offices
    - We'll have about one breakoutroom session per episode
- 
##### Episode 1: Lesson design and development 

Materials: https://coderefinery.github.io/train-the-trainer/lesson-development/
**Discussion:**

- When you start preparing a new lesson or training material, where do you start?
    - I look at existing materials on the same topic, but chose/refine topics based on the perceived needs/interests of the presumed audience
    - Outline of structure and Material collection for a new lesson :+1:    
    - What material I have already? (what other material is already out there?)
    - Start by looking for related resources (documents, videos, courses, etc) to have a base data and better understanding of what have been done around the topic
    - Know your audience
    - Review existing material
    - Think about learning objectives (to keep focus on essential things)
    - Think of three things simple enough that they will be remembered the next day.  Design around that.
    - I write down the thoughts that I have and then go back and structure it.

- What tricks help you with “writer’s block” or the empty page problem?
    - Write anything down that comes to mind, sometimes draw something, looking out the window :)
    - Do a mind map - what concepts do I want to get across?
    - Starting small, for example a list of headings and then building around it. :+1:
    - What does one know about the target audience and why should they be spending longer than 1 minute listening to what they will eventually get to hear?
    - Get some inspiration from another source. 
    - Start with the three things above
    - Start with the plan and the overview design 
    - Some kind of outline / main message(s)
    - Start with three things.  Three supporting points for each of these.
- Maybe you haven’t designed training material yet. But how do you start when creating a new presentation?
    - Think about the learning objectives and try to break them down into steps
    - Title, Objectives, target audience and Plan  
    - Some kind of outline / main message(s). Get as many images as I can, instead of words
    - Draft an outline and use chatgpt to fill in details
    - Example of how the teaching content is applied in a real-world context
- If your design process has changed over time, please describe what you used to do and what you do now instead.
    - I look more at existing materials and try to get more information about the audience. Unfortunately getting information about the audience before the event is hard
    - I used to start from the begginning and get from there but that often meant a very polished start and a rushed end. Now I try an overview first, then fil out sparsed details at every section
    - Updating the data and tweak the presentation
    - If I am teaching a small group (or one to one) talk to them before hand - find out what they know already, what they want to learn. 
- What do you know now about preparing lessons/training/presentations that you wish you knew earlier?
    - less is more. It's better to have 2-3 main messages rather than trying to show everything in one go :+1: :+1: :+1: :+1:
    - how much practice time the learners need to master what's taught
    - Don't worry about something going wrong. It often makes the lesson (and thus the material) more presistent in memory. :+1:
    - Try and remove everything except what you want the person to learn
        - That's a very tough part for me in the sense that I never know how much of an underlying "black box" is still ok.... 
    - Designing intermediate materials is hard, and requires putting some "gatekeeping" making sure that learners are directed to appropriate courses
    - When I see a cool graphic, concept, slide, etc., download it and save it in my 'new-materials' folder to use later on!
    - I have come to the conclusion that perhaps a more "agile" approach to developing materials (try to do design/teaching iterations quickly) might be the best way to go, but there are risks with this approach too

**Questions**

- From zoom chat: Can you expand on what a learner persona is?
    - A defined example person described in terms of the materials you are preparing, making up a story about the background and interest of t
    - Answer from chat: A learner persona is a blackbox which has a very simple algorithm inside: GIGO.
    - Answer from chat: I think it's the same as ICP (Ideal customer persona) where you describe the learner as a customer
    - Answer from chat: I'm a big fan of "How Learning Works" by Ambrose et al https://bookshop.org/p/books/how-learning-works-eight-research-based-principles-for-smart-teaching-michele-dipietro/18640868?ean=9781119861690
    - See also book: [Teaching tech together](http://teachtogether.tech/)
> CodeRefinery lessons: https://coderefinery.org/lessons/
- From chat: Do you have an example of an instructor guide?
    - One example from our [reproducible research lesson](https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/guide/)
    - Another from git intro: https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/guide/
- From zoom chat: Do you have a "measure" of how better are the new lesson compared to the old ones? Does it make sense to talk about measurements here? 
    - So far we only have daily feedback that we collect at the end of the day and we can compare that to earlier daily feedbacks. More about that in the last episode of today. But measuring this is indeed not easy and it also takes time to capture the effect during longer-term surveys. Some of the changes were more leap-of-faith than based on data.
    - I guess that sometimes one can use "compelling arguments" instead of data to justify a decision
- Software Carpentry does teach using the command line, and gives a session on the command line before. What do you think about this approach? Are you stating that a 3-hour lesson about CLI is not sufficient to make people comfortable enough to use that for version control?
    - Yes, good question. For CR we consider it a more advanced step: we do think people should learn command line, but it's for a different course.  We accept some people might not know it or want to know it so adapt to that.
    - In general, we've found the "you need X, but have to learn A, B, and C first" approach should be avoided if possible: people are busy, try to reach people where they are.

##### Episode 2: Lessons with version control

Materials: https://coderefinery.github.io/train-the-trainer/lessons-with-git/

Poll options: I want to hear about: 
- A: Why use version control for teaching materials
- B: Different template options
- C: How CodeRefinery does it; CodeRefinerys lesson template

Poll vote (multi-select): add a `o` to your answer
    - A: ooo
    - B: oooooo
    - C: oooooooo :ghost: 

Question to audience: if someone wants to make a tiny fix to your material, how hard is it?
- If my material is only in pdf format which is not online, then it is hard.
- I hope it is easy - my material is in GitHub. Nobody has ever done that though! 
- Slides: hard to find, easy to edit; Git repos somewhat easy, unless they have to be built locally or with an action; HackMD easiest to edit.
    - if you use something like google slides they are not that difficult to find
    - known permanent address. Google docs et al fail on that/same for many pads. 
- For this material today - very easy! e.g. https://github.com/coderefinery/train-the-trainer/pull/128
- Template with an edit button in the HTML pointing to the source-code in the repo.

**Questions/Discussion topics**
> Upcoming CodeRefinery workshop in September: https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-09-10-workshop/
> Please share with your networks, and let us know if you would like to co-teach a lesson (to support@coderefinery.org or in our [Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/))

- Changes to the material are sometimes not just tiny fixes. For example, one wants to present a slightly different selection of topics, but maybe some topics are "coupled" (perhaps naturally or perhaps just because of how they are presented), or change the general "theme" (e.g., life sciences vs theoretical physics) while keeping the actual topics the same. How could a lesson be developed to avoid having to do a huge rewrite?
    - You can try to modularize your material and keep non topic specific parts non themed. E.g. where you explain the functionality, don't make reference to the example (not simple), so the example can be changed depending on the audience.
- What are the pros/cons of renaming a course / changing a repo name in GitHub?
    - It should be relatively unproblematic since GitHub will forward to the new name. 
        - How long does Github keep the "old" name linked? Is there a max time it's blocked, or changed as soon as a new one appears with the name?
            - in my experience it forwards "forever" until I create a new repo with the old name which will break the forward 
- what should be in the readme for the git repo? (canonical address? contact points? license!)
    - https://coderefinery.github.io/mini-workshop/2/documentation/#often-a-readme-is-enough-checklist 
        - I miss the url to the (main) repo in the readme
            - Do you mean the link to the rendered (lesson) page?
    - Link to rendered page: We often have this in the "about" section of the readme (see up right: https://github.com/coderefinery/train-the-trainer)
    - this gets lost in a fork, doesn't it? so 20 folks forking and or reuploading the repo somewhere means the url gets lost?
        - True, but they might want to have their own version rendered?
            - yes, I have had issues finding and contributing to the "master" repo so all benefit. Else it gets cluttered. Both is valid
                - Good point though, the link to rendered page should probably also be included in the readme for completeness; ah and the link to the repository too, yes 
                    - so realistically we need a content folder and some more next to the readme as a best practice. sounds good!
- Is myst (markdown renderer) enabled by default in sphinx now?
  - to my knowledge no. we add the "myst_parser" extension to conf.py.

**More questions**
- Does the coderefinery.org page built on sphinx?
    - It's built also from markdown but it uses https://www.getzola.org/ (which is more optimized to render websites, but we could do teaching also with Zola or create the project page using Sphinx)

- Is there a way to build and preview CR lessons without the command line?
    - The GitHub workflow we use creates HTML from all branches. This means that one can push a branch to GitHub, preview it there, and then open a pull request. One thing that would be nice but we don't have yet is if a bot automatically posts the link to the preview to a pull request.

- For VCS-2, for the Carpentries Linux shell example, Lesson, Github repo, to me it seemed as though the Sandpaper setup they have makes a very nice interface, complicates the relationship between source and output. E.g on the soucre page https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice/blob/main/index.md I could only see to 'Prerequisits' and not 'Download files' on the page https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/. Perhaps I have missed something?
    - I am sorry I don't know the new Sandpaper setup well enough to answer this question.

- Do we have the instructions to build the lessons available somewhere to try out later?

        - Sphinx, similar to CR
        - Sometimes pdfs generated with beamer package (or from pptx and odt), but blows up repository size if in version control
    - Ex 2:
        - Content
            - CR: Content commonly found int the content folder 
            - SC: Mostly under episodes
    - Question that came up:
        - is CR/Sphinx approach mostly for technical topics? What about language. 
        - I guess by our nature it's focused there.  But probably could be used for others (I guess it it's much easier to use git in a technical audience.)


##### Episode 3: How we collect feedback and measure impact

Materials: https://coderefinery.github.io/train-the-trainer/feedback-and-impact/

**Questions to audience**

- What tricks/techniques have you tried in your teaching or seen in someone else's teaching that you think have been particularly effective in collecting feedback from learners?
   - preparing a survey and emailing it to participants as soon as the event ends (usually get <50% of answers but it's a representative enough sample)
   - do engage with the audience, give them the time to get the courage to speak up
   - Be the audience yourself
      - yes! some problems/issues I don't notice as instructor, only as listener 
   - Have time (e.g. 5 min) in the session to fill out the feedback form
   - If the course/workshop has several days/sections do a couple questions every change, then a full one afterwards
   - "Traffic light" feedback (e.g. for pacing or progress on exercises): give each learner two different coloured post-it notes for in-person, or use emoji for online, to indicate a current status
- Can you give tips or share your experiences about how to convert feedback into changes or actionable items?
   - ask questions about things you know you don't know
   - “Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice.” — Steve Jobs
- When people ask questions / get stuck with a specific step. Is there a typo I can change there and then in the workbook? 
    - Being able to fix small things on the fly helps sometimes, otherwise open issues if working on github
    - If multiple people have the same question, then this is an indication that I should look at this in more detail
- How do you measure the impact of your teaching? Any tips or experiences about what you have tried or seen other courses do?
   - "How likely are you to recommend this workshop to others? (0/5)"
   - Check the 'Garbage Out' bin, what you find there will be what went across. The rest will be history...
- Anybody knows of good resources on survey design? Please link them here.
   - "Our job is to figure out what they're going to want before they do... Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page." - Steve Jobs

**Questions/Discussion points**

- Feedback is necessary to design good lessons. Improvement can only be done iteratively. So the faster the iteration (design/teach), the better. But on the other hand, I cannot constantly bomb our community with training event emails. So I would like to try proposing a course many times a year, but I don't want to spam everybody many times a year.
    - :+1: 
    - With CR we also have a calendar that can be imported to different calendar applications, where we add all workshops: https://github.com/coderefinery/calendar/
- Does an even split of too fast / too slow mean speed is about right?!
  - I take it to mean "it's roughly where it should be".  Would be better to accomdate the sides better though... (we do try to design for a broad audience: some easy stuff, some advanced stuff, so people can make their own path)
  - It could also indicate that the prerequisites/scope are not well defined :+1: 
      - Based on long term surveys we also know though that even though the workshop might have been to fast, people appreciate having "heard things before and know where to find them later"
  - perhaps the even split between too fast/too slow is ok only if the majority of votes goes for "just right" :+1:
- One of the most important disciplines in journalism is to challenge your working premises. (Bill Keller) This applies equally to learning as well.
    - Participants can be encouraged to write some posts on LinkedIn. If it is helpful some blurbs can be created for pre and post-workshop to generate more traction for Code Refinery and future participation.
    - Ask participants if they use Dev.to, hashnode etc to blog their work or use twitter etc to have a memory of their work.
- Do you have any suggestions for prerequisites? I try to make them clear, but occasionally people attend who clearly do not meet them. :+1: 
    - I guess it depends how much it matters for the workshop itself. If you have group exercises etc, it probably matters? , lecture style maybe not so much?; important is that the participants themselves know that prerequisites exist and if they meet them
    - Sometimese people that do not meet the prerequisites join to get to "know what they don't know", find out where to find information on topics they might get interested in future etc 
    - Other suggestions? Viewpoints? :) 
    - Thank you - things for me to think about there :-)
    - With CR's latest ideas, we try to make the prerequisites clear, but there is no capicity limit: it's OK if people drop by and are less than prepared: it's livestream, anyone can come.  We try to have something for these people, too: learn what you are missing, why you might want to study more in the future.
    - Any thoughts on applying this to a more practical focused course, with a total capacity limit (i.e. not like CodeRefinery). 
- Everytime you do a course on CodeRefinery, think of it as trying to bake a new cake with an old recipe with no idea about the individual taste preferences of the one you bake the cake for. Then, you will not experience too many surprises. Fine-tuning the recipe for one cohort still remains the 'old recipe' as far as the next 'new cohort' will be concerned. C'est la vie.
   - nice analogy!
- Question from chat: For examples 2 & 4, would you also consider using something like a Likert scale? E.g. Rate how well you agree with the statement "My code is more reusable as a result of attending a CodeRefinery workshop" (from 1 Strongly disagree to 5 Strongly agree)
    - Thanks! I am new to Likert scale and will read up on it. In my experience numbered answers can be useful for reporting. But I also like questions where we ask for what actually to change.
- Comment from chat: Richard, your point crowns the point of having CodeRefinery, With Radovan's and Samantha's acquiescence assured, I would like to suggest you wear a crown going forward, especially for the CodeRefinery session. Do we have a deal ?
    - I don't quite understand this
    - I *think* it's a tongue-in-cheek-comment (joke) but I am not sure.....
- What is the ideal way to allow people to interact while course is going on in the main online session, i.e. without a breakout room? Taking a pause or discussion in the background?
    - I've had some success with WhatsApp groups for a course - particually ones that run over 4 (or 2) sessions.
    - A quick survey/quiz
    - Question to the audience that we take time to answer but it helps to show the answers

### Feedback about todays session

What one thing was the most valuable/useful thing you learned today? Or generally one thing you liked about this session:
- Lesson design approach
- I liked the backwards lesson design, gives a name to a practice I've already been doing :+1: :+1:
- Lessons from code refinery on lesson design. Learning about Sphinx. 
- Collaborative notes and anonymized archive of notes.
- it's nice to have a community to discuss these kinds of problems
- Hearing the variety of tools people use for slides (PDF, Quarto, Beamer etc.)
- Good intro of the tools, the jargon and the pedagogical philosophy of teaching tech.
- The absolute openess in having everything publicly available - materials ofc but also questions, discussions, feedback, ...
- Thinking about all content being available publicly and as a git repo
- Thanks for explaining the HedgeDoc interface, with view and edit options
    - Is there anyway to come back to this document later (e.g. tomorrow) and see what has changed since now? So I can see if any other questions have been asked/answered?
        - There is a "revision" point under "Menu" up right, which shows you different versions of this document
- Modesty: the gentle art of enhancing your charm by pretending not to be aware of it. - Oliver Herford
- 



What one thing would you improve about this session?
- Perhaps some more interactivity but can be hard to plan and time
    - We'll see what we can do. 
- _Maybe_ mix the breakout groups up for each breakout session (although there are advantages to consistency too) :+1: 
    - yes, pros and cons! For me, having consistency worked well this time. 
    - Likely we will have different participants next week, and a bit of mixing will happen naturally. 
- The pace of the presentations could be a little tighter (the pace is good for a discussion though)
- Richard's voice was only 80% audible
    - Sorry to hear that. It seemed fine on my end. Will check better for next session.
- Hands on simulation and collaborative notes
- I found it difficult to follow the presentation and the collaborative notes at the same time
    - We will highlight the collaborative notes more in the next session. Our strategy usually is to say to focus on the "teaching part" and use the notes only when needed. Since you can go back and also check the notes later.
        - My problem is that I want to follow both since I don't want to miss out on anything. As such, I have both windows (zoom and the notes) open side-by-side. Since there is near-constant real-time typing in the editor, and as such visible movement on screen, I get constantly distracted. This makes following the event quite exhausting.
- Heads up to participants on using the break out rooms on voice interaction and screen sharing.
    - Do you mean that we should have mentioned it more clearly in the pre workshop email?
- I found it hard to follow with so many things going on at once...
    - A collaborative document being changed at the same time as...
    - Someone speaking and explaining content at the same time as...
    - Chat in a different application at the same time as...
    - Content changing in a termin application. 
        - Thank you for the feedback. We will remove the Zoom chat out for the next session and explain the use of the collaborative notes more.
- Make more use of defining and then making sure the learning objectives are met
    - True we did not talk about them much, will pick that up better for next session.
- UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity. - Dennis Ritchie. You need to do a lot to prove that to be wrong, simply put.
- Allocate some time for learners to type in the answers so that we don't have to listen and type at the same time.

Any other comments?
- It's great to hear other people's experience
    - Good to hear :)
- Looking to meet you onsite if there are any events and get more emails from you :) 
    - We will keep you informed :)
- Thanks for putting this together, I got a lot of inspiration for my own courses
    - Good to hear :)
- I didn't know where to ask questions. It would work best *for me* to do it in zoom chat as that's the application that I'm watching in..
    - Sorry for that, just to figure out why: Did you join a bit late?
        - No. Perhaps I just missed that or it was too quick for me or something?
            - Ok, sorry. Will try to make this more clear in next session. 
        - Perhaps also because there were so many things going on and jumping around. For me, the zoom chat is the constant (and obvious) place to ask questions while watching a shared screen, trying to find the right place in a moving collaborative document is difficult. It tears my attention into too many pieces. :+1:
- Had a lot of content that assumed extant knowledge that I didn’t have. This wasn’t in the pre-requisites.
    - Do you have examples?
        - Yes! The code refinery templates and even just the way of doing that. I was expecting more on "when designing a lesson you should think about these steps" rather than this is how we do it and this is our tool for doing it. I guess I should have read the pre-workshop content better?
        - Ok, thank you for your feedback. You are right that we actually had some content that for sure would have been easier to follow for people with background knowledge about a certain topic. 
        - "If you are in CodeRefinery TTT, you probably know what version control is and why it is important." - extant knowledge, why not just add a sentence or two?
            - Please can you update in preparation for the next workshops so that I can decide whether or not they will be right for me?
                - Yes, we will think more thoroughly about this and send the info in the next email going out Wed/Thu
                    - Thank you!
- Lots of the content was relevant to code refinery but not the wider topic (e.g. it was how to design a code refinery lesson and not how to design a lesson as stated in the session title)
    - We thought of the content of showing one way of doing things, ie "what we have learned", if you have suggestions on how we could make that more clear on the event page, please let us know :) 
        - "in a code refinery lesson" in the lesson/workshop description?
- When you have pre-written “thank you for your active participation” it feels fake!
    - He, that is true, did not think about that. Thank you for the feedback. I would not have added it if Radovan and Richard would not have provided good feedback from circling the rooms. 
- I found it vague and disorganised and difficult to follow. It felt like the instructors were presenting the content for the first time and didn't know what to do next.
    - Thank you for your feedback. This is not the first time we have this training, but it is the first time in this constellation/way. The way of teaching may also sometimes make it seem new to instructors.
- I really liked the active exchange with other participants, but I also would have enjoyed a bit more technical content in the presentations. In a sense it felt less like a 'training' and more like a get-together :+1:.
    - Thank you for your feedback. We thought the name "workshop" would combine the training and exchange nature of this event. But maybe it didn't do so enough? Do you have suggestions on how to clarify it on the event page?
        - Well, the 'train the trainer' title created the anticipation of being trained ;) don't get me wrong, I liked the exchange, but I felt that the training aspect fell a little short. imho the workshop would benefit from a little more (instructional) content that is presented in a more structured way by the instructors (as opposed to 'crowd-sourced knowledge' that is collated in a loose collection of questions, notes and links)
        - Other than that, you could add another section on the main page, sth like 'Workshop structure: we aim for a mix of modular presentations and work in small groups. The latter will be done in breakout rooms - be prepared to switch on your camera and have a fruitful exchange with fellow participants!'
            - Thank you for the suggestions, will add something like this :tools:

- My understanding (so far) of what (unlike the competition) CodeRefinery DOES NOT seek to exemplify - 
https://images.ctfassets.net/rxqefefl3t5b/2k45BFtw4sBMlBfjr1OZ90/5c6ecd3628a43b0cdc79815f665e224a/Screenshot_2023-05-02_at_09.35.23.png?fl=progressive&q=80
- My understanding of what (unlike the competition) today's session of CodeRefinery DID exemplify - Definition of 'Workshop' from the Oxford dictionary of the English language "a period of discussion and practical work on a particular subject, in which a group of people share their knowledge and experience"
- In my experience, even for the most seasoned Programmer coding, by its very nature, is nothing trivial, this being a simple straightforward fact just like there is no such thing as an egg which is a cube. I mean there is a reason why not just about everybody is a poet either. But, other minds have pointed this out without having to first explain why the universe is what it is in a way that could be understood without effort ... https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7b/7e/c4/7b7ec4b91d2cf9d8e1b064678d205467.jpg
- The inclusive environment feels very welcoming. Keep up the good work!

**Thank you all for your feedback! Highly appreciated!**
