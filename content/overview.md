:::{instructor-note}
- Teaching: 30 min
- Exercises: 15 min

:::{note}
This episode focuses on the large scale streamed workshop setup. Some of the features can also be applied to smaller scale workshops though.

:::{discussion} In breakoutrooms, summary in collaborative notes:
What kind of roles have you been in yourselves regarding workshops? 
How were you prepared for your role? 
What are the things you would like to know before a workshop?

## One workshop - many parts

```

### Before the workshop

- During winter/summer: "Someone" takes the coordinator role for the next workshop
- Coordinator fills other roles: 
    - Coordinator: collects "necessary lesson updates", supports other coordinators
    - Registration coordinator: Sets up web page, starts and manages registration
    - Instructor coordinator: finds instructors and onboards them (if needed)
    - Advertising coordinator: prepares advertizement texts and finds people to distribute them
    - Team coordinator: Gathers local organizers/teams
    - Bring your own code session coordinator: If available, offer BYOC session after main workshop
- Instructor: gets two-on-one onboarding with (instructor-) coordinator and previous instructor of lesson; update of lesson materials (urgent issues and personal touches)
- Local organizer/Team lead: gets group [onboarding](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/team-leaders/) ~ week/or two before workshop
- Learner: Gets [installation instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/), is offered installation help session, workshop info from event page and summary via e-mail
- Collaborative notes manager sets up the notes document

:::{note}
#### [onboarding](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/team-leaders/)
- **Outline of what will happen during the workshop**
- Discussion of different strategies to handle the exercise sessions
- Lowering the barrier to ask for support by meeting some organizers
- Q&A
:::

:::{note}
#### [Installation instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/)
- Instructions for all operating systems
- We would like learners to leave the workshop and be ready to apply the learned tools and techniques to their own work
- Support session for challenges with installations
:::



### During the workshop

```{figure} img/BYOC.png
Image showing the different ways learners can do the exercises. No matter which way they choose, they always watch the stream and interact with instructors and organizers via collaborative notes. Individual learners do the exercises alone, people in online or local classrooms in addition get to discuss with their peers.
```

- Everyone watches stream
- Co-instructors present content and answer questions in collaborative notes
- Collaborative notes manager keeps the collaborative notes clean, helps answering questions, adds sections and archives the document after each day
- Learners do exercises individually or in team
- Local organizer / Team lead guides learners through exercises and facilitates discussion
- (Registration-) coordinator sends out e-mails to participants after each day, summarizing the day and preparing for the next day
- Director/Broadcaster manages the streaming (see session 4)

### After the workshop

- Coordinator collects lessons learned based on experience and feedback and turns them into issues
- Coordinator organizes debriefing week after the workshop, where anyone can join to give feedback
- "Someone" sends out post-workshop survey half a year after workshop 
- Bring your own code sessions
- Broadcaster prepares and shares recording (see session 4)

:::{note}
#### Bring your own code sessions

We want to support learners to apply what they have learned in the workshop to their own work by offering one/two sessions where they can drop in, and discuss challenges with CodeRefinery instructors and helpers.

:::

## This sounds like a lot of people and time investment!

- Many roles can be combined or adjusted as needed
- Some roles can be taken on by multiple people

Recommended minimum: 2-3 people
Optimum: ~ 10 people

## How did we get to this setup?

- **Collaborative** in-person workshops since 2016 around the Nordics
- Moved online in 2020
- Started with "traditional zoom" workshops, breakoutrooms, volunteer helpers
- Thought about scaling and ease of joining -> current setup (More about this in session 4)
- Continuous development

We also still do smaller scale local workshops, if instructors are available. You can offer your own CodeRefinery workshop by inviting other CodeRefinery instructors. You can also reuse single lessons and integrate them into your own teaching.
