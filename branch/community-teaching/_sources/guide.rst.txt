Instructor's guide
------------------

In a lesson that was further developed, this would include an
instructor's guide that mentioned:

* Background of why the course is how it is
* Recommendations of teaching it
* Known pitfalls of teaching it, so that other instructors can avoid
  them
* Possibly how to contribute, long-term plans, etc.

For example, see `git-intro's instructor guide
<https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/guide/>`__.
