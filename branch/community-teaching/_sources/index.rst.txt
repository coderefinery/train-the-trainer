Community teaching training
===========================

.. admonition:: Under development (mid 2022)

   As of mid-2022, this material has been reworked for our summer workshop and
   for the CarpentryCon 2022 workshop.  The material will continue to be
   improved before a longer training session in the autumn.

   This material is the new version of our previous `Instructor
   training <https://coderefinery.github.io/instructor-training/>`__.


What this course covers
-----------------------

In 2020, we got farther from our offices but closer to each other.  If
you could adapt to the circumstances, a huge number of possibilities
were opened - in particular with collaborative teaching.  In this
training, you will learn how we use them.  Teaching from 2019 is
almost obsolete - join us to learn more.

- **Tools of teaching**: how to make the most out of online (and
  other) teaching.
- **Workshop organization, collaboratively**: our vision of teaching
  together outside of our silos.
- **Socio-technical factors**: social and technical barriers to
  learning, why you need to care, and what you can do about them.
- **Lesson development, collaboratively**: how to design lessons and
  teaching materials so that they can be open and shared.


Who is the course for?
----------------------

Teaching is a profession, but also something that everyone needs to be
able to do to some degree, since everyone has their own personal
specialties they will either teach or mentor.

This course can be relevant for different learner personas:

- **You run a practical teaching program** at your institution (for example
  as part of a research computing group) and would like to learn best
  practices for collaborative teaching, so that you aren't re-inventing
  the same thing over and over again.

- **You are a technical specialist** who is frustrated with the way you
  currently try to teach others who need to use your software or
  infrastructure.  You can't spend too much time to become a
  professional, but you know you need something more than what you've
  been doing.  Thus, you would like to adopt some of the best practices of
  designing and teaching interactive, hands-on workshops.

- **You've been teaching alone**, but would like to join a collaboration
  network for more co-teaching and to reduce the amount of duplication
  of effort.

- **You are interested in teaching CodeRefinery lessons**, and would like a
  comprehensive kick-start to how CodeRefinery works, either to join us,
  or teach its lessons with us or independently.
