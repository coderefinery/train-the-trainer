HackMD
======

The name "HackMD" doesn't do this concept justice, nor do the more
common descriptions of "shared notes" or "collaborative document".  It
is a full replacement for chat: perhaps it could be called **random
access chat** or **parallel 2D chat** ?

**HackMD** itself is a web service for collaborative documents in
Markdown.  This isn't special to HackMD, but we have used it for its
scalability, markdown support, and privacy in the "view" mode.

* HackMD manager role description: https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-helper/
* Example published HackMD after six 3-hour CodeRefinery sessions: https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-03-22-workshop/questions/



Advantages
----------

* Synchronous questions, no disadvantage for quiet people.
* Anonymous questions.
* Parallel answers by a large number of helpers.
* Easier to go back and review past questions during Q&A sessions
  (compared to scrolling through chat), for example finding important
  or unanswered questions.
* The above can make a course feel much more interactive than it would
  otherwise.



Disadvantages
-------------

* *Overwhelming* flood of information

  * But you wanted more interaction, right?
  * Co-teaching helps here, one person can focus on watching.
  * Students must be warned to be deliberate about where they focus
    their attention (different learners have different interests).

* It is another tool to use

  * Not required for basic learners, learners can begin using when
    they are comfortable.



Exercise
--------

.. exercise::

   * Actively use HackMD during this course.
   * Observe how the instructors integrate it during the course
     itself, and can immediately respond to the questions.
   * Observe how instructors occasionally mention and screenshare
     HackMD to validate to the audience that it is being watched.
   * Keep HackMD open.  Can you balance it and watching.  Does it
     increase or decrease engagement?
