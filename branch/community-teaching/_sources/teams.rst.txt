Teams
=====

Everyone wants interaction in courses, yet when a group size gets too
large, it doesn't have much interaction.  A event in a physical space
naturally makes teams based on who is nearby.  When done online, this
needs to be more explicit.

Basic concepts
--------------

- Teams are pre-assigned
- **Exercise leaders** (aka helpers) assigned per team
- Teams stay together during the whole workshop.
- Learners can sign up either alone...
- ... or they can sign up with **a pre-made team**: people who know
  each.  "bring your own breakout room":

  - When two people in a work group learn a skill, uptake within the
    group is often much higher.  Thus, we strongly encourage pre-made
    teams that know each other.

  - Teams that all come from the same group or field, with a helper
    from that field, can transition to help



Online
------

In the best online implementations, our teams have these properties:

- Coordination of breakout rooms is a *lot* of work.
- In zoom, we could request learners to rename to ``(N) Learner
  Name``, and then quickly assign people.  Now, you can have learners
  self-select their rooms.  But will they actually do this, or stay in
  main room?

- One helper is assigned per team.

  - In fact, we would limit the number of registrations to 5Ã— the
    number of helpers so that all teams have a helper

- Our registration system (indico) is capable of mailing personalized
  messages per person with their team information.  This is quite a
  bit of work to manage.

But they have these disadvantages:

- Much, much harder registration coordination, almost to the point of
  being impossible.
- Number of attendees.
- Difficulties when attendees drop out partway through a course.



In-person
---------

Teams may natuarally form based on setting location, but

- Teams may happen naturally by sitting at the same table
- Do teams stay the same day after day?
- Do teams get arranged in a manner useful for learning?
- Do you have one helper per team?
- Do you encourage people to interact explicitly enough?
- Do you ensure that no one gets left out in the crowd?  Are the teams
  explicit enough?



Discussion: what we actually do
-------------------------------

- For large enough CodeRefinery workshops, assign teams with one
  helper each.  Deal with re-adjustment
- The livestream option allows everyone else to follow along.
- In other workshops, create breakout rooms but somehow try let people
  self-assign.  Most don't.
- For large workshops without enough staff help, livestream and
  encourage people to form their own teams and watch themselves - we
  don't actually need to be involved.
- Teams can be delegated to a local organizer.



Exercises

.. exercise:: Teams

   Consider these questions:

   - Should teams have similar or different people in them?
