## Why version control?

- If you are in CodeRefinery TTT, you probably know what version
  control is and why it is important.
- The benefits of version control also extend to lessons:
  - Change history
  - Others can submit contributions
  - Others can make derived versions and sync up later
  - Same workflow as everything else
  - Write it like documentation: probably more reading after than
    watching it as a presentation.
- Disadvantages
  - "What you see is what you get" editing is hard
  - Requires knowing version control

:::{discussion} Accepting the smallest contribution

Question: if someone wants to make a tiny fix to your material, can they?

## Tour of lesson templates options

There are different ways to make lessons with git.  Some dedicated to
teaching:

- CodeRefinery
  - Example: This lesson itself
  - Based on the Sphinx documentation generator
  - [sphinx-lesson](https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson) is
    *very* minimal extra functionality
- Carpentries
  - Example: <https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/>
  - Based on R and Rmarkdown

Our philosophy is that anything works: it doesn't have to be just
designed for lessons

- Jupyter Book
  - Example: https://jupyterbook.org/
  - Note: is based on sphinx, many extensions here are used in CR lessons
- Various ways to make slides out of Markdown
- Cicero: GitHub-hosted Markdown to slides easily
  - [Demo: Asking for Help with
    Supercomputers](https://cicero.xyz/v3/remark/0.14.0/github.com/bast/help-with-supercomputers/main/talk.md/#1)
    [The source](https://github.com/bast/help-with-supercomputers/blob/main/talk.md)
- Whatever your existing documentation is.

**We like the CodeRefinery format, but think that you should use
whatever fits your needs the most.**


## [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org)

- We build all our lesson material with Sphinx
- Generate HTML/PDF/LaTeX from RST and Markdown.
- Many Python projects use Sphinx for documentation but **Sphinx is not limited to Python**.
- [Read the docs](https://readthedocs.org) hosts public Sphinx documentation for free!
- Also hostable anywhere else, like Github pages, like our lesson material
- For code a selling point for Sphinx is that also API documentation
  is possible.

Sphinx is a doc generator, not HTML generator. It can:

- Markdown, Jupyter, and ReST (and more...) inputs.  Executable inputs.
  - jupyter-book is Sphinx, so anything it can do we can do. This was one of the
    inspirations for using Sphinx
- Good support for inline code. Much more than static code display, if
  you want to look at extensions.
- Generate different output formats (html, single-page html, pdf, epub, etc.)
- Strong cross-referencing within and between projects


## [CodeRefinery lesson template](https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson-template)

It is "just a normal Sphinx project" - with extensions:
- [Sphinx lesson extension](https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson)
  - adds is various directives (boxes) tuned to lesson purposes
  - provides a sample organization and template repo you can use so that lessons look consistent
- Sphinx gives us other nice features for free
  - Tabs: they are very important for us and allow us to customize in-place instead of copying everything and fragmenting lessons
  - Emphasize lines: they make it easier to spot what has changed in longer code snippets
  - Various input formats
    - Markdown (via the MyST-parser), ReStructured text, Jupyter
      Notebooks.
  - Many other features designed for presenting and interacting with code
- It's fine if you use some other static site generator or git-based lesson method.

:::{demo} Instructors go through the building and contributing process

Depending on the course, instructors will demo what is roughly
exercise 4 below.  Or a course might go straight to exercises.

- Instructors decide what change they would want to make
- Instructors clone the repository
- **Instructors make the change**
- **Instructors set up the build environment**
- **Instructors build and preview**
- Instructors command and send upstream
:::


## Exercises

Some exercises have prerequisites (Git or Github accounts).  Most
instances of this course will have you do **1 and 2** below.

:::{exercise} Lesson-VCS-1: Present and discuss your own lesson formats

We don't want to push everyone towards one format, but as long as you
use Git, it's easy to share and reuse.

- Discuss what formats you do use
- Within your team, show examples of the lessons formats you use
  now.  Discuss what is good and to-be-improved about them.
- Look at how they source is managed and how easy it might be to edit.
:::


:::{exercise} Lesson-VCS-2: Tour a CodeRefinery or Carpentries lesson on Github
- Look at either a CodeRefinery or Carpentries lesson
  - CodeRefinery Git-Intro: [Lesson](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/), [Github repo](https://github.com/coderefinery/git-intro)
  - Carpentries Linux shell: [Lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), [Github repo](https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice/)
- Can you find
  - Where is the content of the lessons?
  - What recent change propsals (pull requests) have been made?
  - What are the open issues?
  - How you would contribute something?
  - How would you use this yourself?
:::


:::{exercise} Lesson-VCS-3: Modify a CodeRefinery example lesson on Github
In this, you will make a change to a lesson on Github, using only the
Github interface.  (Github account required, and we assume some
knowledge of Github.  Ask for help in your team if it is new to you!)

- Navigate to the example lesson we have set up:
  [repo](https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson-scratch-space), [web](https://coderefinery.github.io/sphinx-lesson-scratch-space/)
- Go to some page and follow the link to go to the respective page on
  Github. (Alternatively, you can find the page from the Github repo directly).
- Follow the Github flow to make a change, and open a Pull Request
  with the change proposal:
  - Click on the pencil icon
  - Make a change
  - Follow the flow to make a commit and change.  You'll fork the
    repository to make your own copy, add a message, and open a pull
    request.

We will look at these together and accept some changes.
:::


:::{exercise} Lesson-VCS-4: Clone and build a CodeRefinery lesson locally
In this exercise, you will use Git to clone one a CodeRefinery lesson
and try to preview it locally.  It assumes installation and knowledge
of Git.

- Use this sample repository:
  [git-intro](https://github.com/coderefinery/git-intro) (or whatever
  else you would like)
- Clone the repository to your own computer
- Create a virtual environment using the ``requirements.txt``
  contained within the repository.
- Build the lesson.
  - Most people will probably run: `sphinx-build content/ _build/`
  - If you have `make` installed you can `make html`
  - Look in the `_build` directory for the built HTML files.

Overall, this is pretty easy and straightforward, if you have a Python
environment set up.  The [CodeRefinery documentation
lesson](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/sphinx/) teaches
this for every operating system.

This same tool can be used to build documentation for other software
projects and is pretty standard.
:::


:::{exercise} Lesson-VCS-5: (advanced) Create your own lesson using the CodeRefinery format
In this lesson, you'll copy the CodeRefinery template and do basic
modifications for your own lesson.

- Clone the lesson template:
  https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson-template
- Attempt to build it as it is (see the previous exercise)
- How can you do tabs?
- How can you highlight lines in code boxes?
- How can you change color, logo and fonts?
- What directives are available?

:::


## Summary

:::{keypoints}
- Version control takes teaching materials to the next level:
  shareable and easy to contribute
- There are different formats that use version control, but we like
  Sphinx with a sphinx-lesson extension.
