# Pre-workshop preparation


## You don't have to be a [Carpentries instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/)

Being a [Carpentries instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/) is not
required to attend CodeRefinery instructor training workshop.

> ## Preparation before the workshop (takes ca. 1 hour)
>
> - Complete our pre-workshop survey. Your responses will help us to customize the workshop appropriately.
>
> - Read this short paper [The Science of Learning](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf) which provides a brief overview of some key evidence-based results in teaching. This paper is also used by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) for their Instructor Training workshops.
>
> - Watch at least two of recorded ca. 5-minute
>   [lightning overview videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpLblYHCzJABvt25VY0wNIgbaQfTQaND7)
>   introducing various
>   [CodeRefinery lessons](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/)
>   to get an overview of what we teach in CodeRefinery and also to be
>   able to practice CodeRefinery teaching on day 2 of this course.
>
> - Watch at least two of recorded
>   ["this is my training philosophy" videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpLblYHCzJAAHF89P-GCjEXWC8CF-7nhX)

>   exercise.

>   topic/episode/aspect that you find interesting. During a group session you
>   will be asked to present a topic/episode/aspect of your choice for 5
>   minutes and get constructive feedback.

> Don't worry if there are sections you do not understand. The main objective
