CodeRefinery instructor training
================================

CodeRefinery instructor training is focused on helping competent practitioners
and experts teach their knowledge to others.  It also serves a
kickstart to teaching CodeRefinery lessons, but we also have a
gradual pathway of learner → helper → advanced helper → instructor as
well.


.. prereq::

   This course has no strict prerequisites, but

   * It is helpful if you have attended CodeRefinery or Carpentries
     workshops, which teach in an interactive and hands-on way.

   * We assume you already have competence in the technical tools you
     want to teach.  Many of our concepts use examples from
     CodeRefinery lessons, such as version control or other software
     development tools.

   * While not a prerequisite for this course, version control (git)
     is necessary to contribute to lessons development the way we show
     here (but the lesson design concepts are applicable to other
     styles, too).

Who is the course for?
----------------------

You are interested in teaching CodeRefinery lessons, and would like a
comprehensive kickstart to how CodeRefinery works either to join us,
or teach its lessons with us or independently.

You are a technical specialist who is frustrated with the way you
currently try to teach others who need to use your software or
infrastructure.  You can't spend too much time to become a
professional, but you know you need something more than what you've
been doing.  Thus, you would like to adopt some of the best practices of
designing and teaching interactive, hands-on workshops.

You've been teaching alone, but would like to join a collaboration
network for more co-teaching and to reduce the amount of duplication
of effort.

You would like the most important practices from the Carpentries
instructor training/lesson design philosophy, but can not take the
time for the full Carpentries program.
