# Organize a CodeRefinery workshop

You or us?
- Historically, most workshops are CodeRefinery workshops were
  organized centrally with a local host.
- Now, we want to transition to locally-invited workshops, so we know
  we have a audience and advertisement.
- In the future, we need to transition to "independently run".

Anyone can organize a CodeRefinery workshop and teach the CodeRefinery lessons which are

However, making it a successful workshop requires careful planning and preparation. Here we will go
through practical aspects of organizing a workshop.

## Centrally organized workshops

- CodeRefinery staff organize, we try to reach as many people as
  possible.
- Workshops in our own institutions tend to be best-attended, going to
  a new institution sometimes has low attendance.
- We started this way.


## Locally invited workshops

- A local team requests CodeRefinery (usually with a known audience).
- There is usually pretty good attendance.
- CodeRefinery staff travels to site and teaches - at least with local
  helpers, ideally with a local instructor.

## Independently organized workshops

- In the future, we want to encourage independently organized
  workshops: a site can organize the workshops without needing to go
  through the core team.
- We don't yet know exactly how this will work, but this instructor
  training is part of it.
