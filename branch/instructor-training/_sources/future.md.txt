## Biggest open problems

- How to give helpers and contributors more credit and visibility
- How to promote/engage new members
- We don't know how we should be in relation with Carpentries
- What are we? Non-profit? Institution collaboration network? Selling services?
- Funding and sustainability (but we have ideas: collaboration network)
- Scalability and marketing question: How to reach more people?
  ([Research Software Hour](https://researchsoftwarehour.github.io/), Twitch, streaming-only
  workshops, recording, post-processing videos)

## Certification for CodeRefinery instructors

We will set up a more formal process soon but for now you would need to:

- Attend an instructor training (this workshop).
- Contribute to a lesson, either via pull request, issue, discussion, or as a helper.
- Share a short teaching demo or teach a lesson at a CodeRefinery workshop where you will get some feedback on your teaching.
- Participate in a call with other instructors and helpers either preparing a workshop or during a workshop debrief session.

There are many ways to learn how to teach well.  We and carpentries provide one way and basic material, but we want to find a way for everyone to be a part of us.
