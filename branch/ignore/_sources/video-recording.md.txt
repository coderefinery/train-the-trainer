# Video recording

```{keypoints}
- We don't expect many people to watch the recording from scratch later (but
  some do) (some might look afterwards a few pieces, cmp. reading a book vs
  look ing sth up from a book)
- Learners getting an "instant replay" to review, or to **make up for a lost day**, is great.
- Privacy is more important than any other factor
- **Recording only works if privacy is guaranteed and effort is low**.
  This is only possible with the **instructor-audience split setup** of livestreaming.
```


## We try to release videos on the same day

Video recordings could be useful for people attending a course later, but also
are (perhaps more) useful for **immediate review and catching up after missing
a day in a workshop**.

For this, they need to be released immediately, within a few hours of the
workshop (see {doc}`video-editing`).  CodeRefinery can do this.

For the videos to be released soon we need to make sure we guarantee privacy of
learners (see below). Our livestream setup makes the privacy guarantee easy at
the cost of separating instructors and learners into different video rooms.

Good preparation and documentation helps to make video recording and video
editing easier.


## Privacy is more important than any other factor

If we can't guarantee privacy, we can't release videos at all.

Some events add a disclaimers such as "if you don't want to appear
in a recording, leave your video off and don't say anything".  We
would prefer not to do this, since:
- we *know* accidents happen (especially when coming back from breakout rooms)
- it creates an incentive to not interact by voice/video
- it could pressure participants to not object in order "to not be difficult"

**Livestreaming solves this for us**:

- By separating the instruction from
  the audience audio/video, there is no privacy risk in the raw
  recording.  They could be released or shared unprocessed.

- Recording with Zoom in a large meeting with all the instructors and
  learners is simple, but not good for privacy: there are always
  mistakes, reviewing takes too long.

- Livestream platforms also provide instant recordings of the whole
  stream, and some make instant replays possible.  This could remove
  the need for making our own videos, since one of the most important
  cases is this instant replay idea.


## Broadcasting role and setup

In the live-streaming setup, the Broadcasting role is central to video
recording.
