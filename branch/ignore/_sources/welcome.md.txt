## Goals for this workshop

```{discussion} Goals for this instructor training
- **Inspire teachers and staff who have to teach indirectly as part of
  their job**: use best practices for the modern world, especially
  for online teaching.
- **Promote collaboration in teaching**: less going alone.
- **Promote CodeRefinery sustainability**: form a network that can
  work together to share the work and benefits.
```


### Giving confidence

> *Goal number one should be that we give participants the confidence to
> independently apply the tools or knowledge learnt. This is more important
> that giving a "complete" overview.* [Lucy Whalley gave this great comment at one of our workshops]

- You don't have to know everything to use (or teach) something.
- For the large majority of topics we teach, there are many resources online
  which provide how-to guides or tutorials. And the Stack Overflow answer bank
  isn't getting any smaller. So we need to ask why do people attend in-person
  sessions if there is information freely available? Our impression is that
  it is for confidence building, identity formation, perhaps signposting to
  resources.
- This also links with building a welcoming/inclusive environment: for example,
  imposter syndrome, which disproportionately affects under-represented groups
  ([link](https://www.ncda.org/aws/NCDA/pt/sd/news_article/245005/_PARENT/CC_layout_details/false)),
  can manifest as low self-confidence --> building the confidence of
  students in the classroom may lead to a more diverse community.

## Tools for this workshop

We often start workshops with these:
- [HackMD mechanics and controls](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/)
- [Zoom mechanics and controls](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/zoom-mechanics/) (but this got less relevant
  since starting teaching via live-streaming where participants only interact via HackMD)

## Code of Conduct

- We follow [The CodeRefinery Code of
  Conduct](https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/).
- This is a hands-on, interactive workshop.
    - Be kind to each other and help each other as best you can.
    - If you can't help someone or there is some problem, let someone know.
    - If you notice something that prevents you from learning as well as you can, let us know and don't suffer silently.
- It's also about the little things:
    - volume
    - font size
    - generally confusing instructor
    - **not enough breaks**
