Diversity and inclusion
=======================

When we are teaching, we fill a critical role in between people and
technology.  We are not un-involved technical staff teaching asocial
topics, but we are very connected to the social context of the tools.
Unfortunately, there are major demographic imbalances in most
computing.

Summary:

* Computing is hard and quite often our ability to learn quickly is
  connected to our social group.
* Good technical services serve the role of mentors
* This mentorship helps to equalize
* Our entire system of research should be configured for more
  equality.  Modernization usually takes it the other way.
