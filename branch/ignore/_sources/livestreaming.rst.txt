Livestreaming
=============

In a large lecture, in effect, you don't interact with most people -
not even close.  Yet, trying to force this limited interaction greatly
limits our possible reach, and keeps us in an awkward state of
expecting live interaction yet usually receiving minimal.  When we try
this online, it forces a closed

Teaching via livestreaming allows us to:

* Reach a near-unlimited number of people
* Fully embrace online tools for interaction, instead of asking people
  to speak up.  This equalizes the participation for shy or passive
  participants.
* By being large, be more efficient and use the extra resources for
  meaningful interactions in small groups.

  * Online livestream

   The general presence and information flow within the MOOC strategy.

* CodeRefinery livestreams via Twitch, but Twitch is not an essential
  aspect.

* We can invite anyone in the world, no risk of disruptions from
  trolls.

* This has enabled us to fully embrace strategies such as HackMD and
  co-teaching.

  * While we tried these in-person, they didn't work well since the
    loud, extroverted people would dominate.



Tech details
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* We stream by using OBS to capture a Zoom meeting.  We can switch
  between a gallery view, screenshare, and mixed.

* Dedicated instructor Zoom meeting - no learners.  Thus, no chance of
  privacy violations.

  * Learners can attend different ways: a) independently online  b)
    in-person breakout room c) Zoom breakout rooms.

* We don't have time to get into details here... see the linked
  documents and also join us for in-person experience while we improve
  our materials more.
