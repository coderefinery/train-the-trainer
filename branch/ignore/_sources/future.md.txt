# Possibilities for Carpentries

```{keypoints}
- Carpentries is currently designed around small workshops, so many of these ideas can't directly apply
- Yet **many of these tools and also team teaching can still be used**
- You can run your own breakout room for any of our workshops
- Join as observer if you want to see our workshop organization and tools in action
```

CodeRefinery workshops can be a good progression step after taking a
Carpentries workshop.

Helping out at a CodeRefinery workshop as exercise lead can be a good
progression step for those who have helped out at a Carpentries workshop or who
have taken the Carpentries instructor training.


# CodeRefinery's plans

```{keypoints}
- We are continuing to focus on online-first with local breakout rooms
- We welcome people joining us, either individually or as an organization
- Still interested in collaboration with Carpentries
- We need to become better at marketing and outreach
```


## Biggest open problems

- How to give helpers and contributors more credit and visibility

- Funding and sustainability (but we have ideas: collaboration network)
