<p>As of mid-2022, this material has been reworked for our summer workshop and
for the CarpentryCon 2022 workshop.  The material will continue to be
improved before a longer training session in the autumn.</p>
<p>This material is the new version of our previous <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/instructor-training/">Instructor

<p>In 2020, we got farther from our offices but closer to each other.  If
you could adapt to the circumstances, a huge number of possibilities
were opened - in particular with collaborative teaching.  In this
training, you will learn how we use them.  Teaching from 2019 is
almost obsolete - join us to learn more.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Tools of teaching</strong>: how to make the most out of online (and
other) teaching.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Workshop organization, collaboratively</strong>: our vision of teaching
together outside of our silos.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Socio-technical factors</strong>: social and technical barriers to
learning, why you need to care, and what you can do about them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lesson development, collaboratively</strong>: how to design lessons and
teaching materials so that they can be open and shared.</p></li>

<p>Teaching is a profession, but also something that everyone needs to be
able to do to some degree, since everyone has their own personal
specialties they will either teach or mentor.</p>
<p>This course can be relevant for different learner personas:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>You run a practical teaching program</strong> at your institution (for example
as part of a research computing group) and would like to learn best
practices for collaborative teaching, so that you aren’t re-inventing
the same thing over and over again.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You are a technical specialist</strong> who is frustrated with the way you
currently try to teach others who need to use your software or
infrastructure.  You can’t spend too much time to become a
professional, but you know you need something more than what you’ve
been doing.  Thus, you would like to adopt some of the best practices of
designing and teaching interactive, hands-on workshops.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You’ve been teaching alone</strong>, but would like to join a collaboration
network for more co-teaching and to reduce the amount of duplication
of effort.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You are interested in teaching CodeRefinery lessons</strong>, and would like a
comprehensive kick-start to how CodeRefinery works, either to join us,
or teach its lessons with us or independently.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<div><p><em>Goal number one should be that we give participants the confidence to
independently apply the tools or knowledge learnt. This is more important
that giving a “complete” overview.</em> [Lucy Whalley gave this great comment at one of our workshops]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You don’t have to know everything to use (or teach) something.</p></li>
<li><p>For the large majority of topics we teach, there are many resources online
which provide how-to guides or tutorials. And the Stack Overflow answer bank
isn’t getting any smaller. So we need to ask why do people attend in-person
sessions if there is information freely available? Our impression is that
it is for confidence building, identity formation, perhaps signposting to
resources.</p></li>
<li><p>This also links with building a welcoming/inclusive environment: for example,
imposter syndrome, which disproportionately affects under-represented groups
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ncda.org/aws/NCDA/pt/sd/news_article/245005/_PARENT/CC_layout_details/false">link</a>),

<p>CodeRefinery is a
<a class="reference external" href="https://neic.no/">Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC)</a>
project that has started in October 2016 and is
funded until February 2025.</p>
<p>The funding from 2022-2025 is designed to keep this project active
beyond 2025 by forming a support network and building a community of
instructors and contributors.</p>
<div class="admonition-history discussion important admonition" id="discussion-0">
<p class="admonition-title">History</p>
<p>The CodeRefinery project idea grew out of two <a class="reference external" href="http://sese.nu">SeSE</a> courses given at KTH Stockholm in 2014 and 2016:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://sese.nu/scientific-software-development-toolbox/">http://sese.nu/scientific-software-development-toolbox/</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://sese.nu/scientific-software-development-toolbox-2016/">http://sese.nu/scientific-software-development-toolbox-2016/</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The project proposal was submitted to NeIC in 2015, accepted in 2015, and started in 2016.</p>
<p>We have started by porting own lessons to the Carpentries teaching style and
format, and collaboratively and iteratively grew and improved the material to
its present form.</p>

<h4>Main goals<a class="headerlink" href="#main-goals" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Develop and maintain <strong>training material on software best practices</strong> for researchers that already write code. Our material addresses all academic disciplines and tries to be as programming language-independent as possible.</p></li>

<section id="impact">
<h4>Impact<a class="headerlink" href="#impact" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>We collect feedback and survey results to measure our impact.</p>
<p>3-6 months after attending a workshop, past participants are asked to complete a short post-workshop survey.
The survey questions aim to establish what impact CodeRefinery workshops have on how past participants develop
research software.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.org/about/impact/">Pre- and post-workshop survey results</a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Overall quality of research software has improved: more reusable, modular, reproducible and documented.</p></li>

<li><p>Past participants share their new knowledge with colleagues</p></li>
<li><p>Usage of several tools is improved, and new tools are adopted</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.org/#what-do-our-participants-say-after-attending-a-workshop">Free-form answers</a>
also suggest that workshops are having the intended effects on how people develop code. A common theme is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>I wish I had known this stuff already as a grad student 10+ years ago…</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We would love to get suggestions on how we can better quantify our impact. This

also open up funding opportunities.</p>

<h5>Carpentries audience<a class="headerlink" href="#carpentries-audience" title="Link to this heading"></a></h5>
<p>The Carpentries aims to teach computational <strong>competence</strong> to learners through an applied approach, avoiding the theoretical and general in favor of the practical and specific.</p>
<p><strong>Learners do not need to have any prior experience in programming.</strong>  One major goal of a Carpentry workshop is to raise awareness on the tools researchers can learn/use to speed up their research.</p>
<p>By showing learners how to solve specific problems with specific tools and providing hands-on practice, learners develops confidence for future learning.</p>

<p>We often qualify Carpentry learners as <strong>novices</strong>: they do not know what they need to learn yet. A typical example is the usage of version control: the Carpentry <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span></code> lesson aims to give a very high level conceptual overview of Git but it does not explain how it can be used in research projects.</p>

<h5>CodeRefinery audience<a class="headerlink" href="#coderefinery-audience" title="Link to this heading"></a></h5>
<p>In that sense, CodeRefinery workshops differ from Carpentry workshops as we assume our audience already writes code and scripts and we aim at teaching them <strong>best software practices</strong>.</p>
<p>Our learners usually do not have a good overview of <strong>best software practices</strong> but are aware of the need to learn them. Very often, they know the tools (Git, Jupyter, etc.) we are teaching but have difficulties to make the best use of them in their software development workflow.</p>
<p>Whenever we can, we should direct learners that do not have sufficient coding experience to Carpentries workshops.</p>
<div class="admonition-competent-practitioners callout admonition" id="callout-1">
<p class="admonition-title">Competent practitioners</p>
<p>We often qualify CodeRefinery learners as <strong>competent practitioners</strong> because they already have an understanding of their needs.

<p>It can be useful to ask the question: <em>best software practices for whom</em>?
CodeRefinery teaches <em>best software practices</em> derived from producing and
shipping software. These practices are also very good for sharing software,
though our audience will probably not need to embrace <em>all</em> aspects of
software engineering.</p>

<p>Is online teaching better or worse?  As usual for that question, “it’s
all a trade-off”.  We believe that many people tried to directly
translate in-person strategies to online, and teaching suffered.  In
some ways, this even revealed the flaws of in-person pedagogy (remove
some interaction and not much is left other than an info-dump).</p>

<h3>Team teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#team-teaching" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>One of the most significant improvemest of our teaching has been the
concept of <strong>co-teaching</strong>.</p>
<div class="admonition-co-teaching admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Co-teaching</p>
<p>Wikipedia: Co-teaching or team teaching is the division of labor
between educators to plan, organize, instruct and make assessments
on the same group of students, generally in the a common
classroom,[1] and often with a strong focus on those teaching as a
team complementing one another’s particular skills or other
strengths.</p>
</div>
<p><em>This is not strictly an effect of moving online</em>.  However, the
larger number of instructors and larger audiences make this practical
on a wide scale.</p>

<h4>Benefits<a class="headerlink" href="#benefits" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The course seems very interactive, much more so than expecting
students to speak up.  The co-teacher can take on the “voice of the
audience”.</p></li>
<li><p>Quicker preparation time since co-teachers can rely on each other in
unexpected situations.</p></li>
<li><p>One co-teacher can be effectively learning at the same time and thus
acting as the “voice of the audience” in another way.</p></li>
<li><p>Great way to onboard new instructors - extensive training and
preparation no longer needed.</p></li>
<li><p>More active minds means better able to watch and react to other
feedback, such as HackMD or chat.</p></li>
<li><p>Less workload - one person does not have to prepare perfectly, any
uncertainty can usually be quickly answered by the other.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>One person gives lectures, one does the typing during demos.</p></li>
<li><p>“Interview”: One primarily doing the “teaching”, one guiding by
asking questions - either as an interviewer or as a virtual learner.</p></li>

<p>Things that don’t work (are not team teaching):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Dividing up a lesson into parts, each person gives different parts

<p>Video recordings could be useful for people attending a course later, but also
are (perhaps more) useful for <strong>immediate review and catching up after missing
a day in a workshop</strong>.</p>
<p>For this, they need to be released immediately, within a few hours of the
workshop (see <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-video-editing"><span class="doc">Video editing</span></a>).  CodeRefinery can do this.</p>
<p>For the videos to be released soon we need to make sure we guarantee privacy of
learners (see below). Our livestream setup makes the privacy guarantee easy at
the cost of separating instructors and learners into different video rooms.</p>
<p>Good preparation and documentation helps to make video recording and video
editing easier.</p>

<h4>Privacy is more important than any other factor<a class="headerlink" href="#privacy-is-more-important-than-any-other-factor" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>If we can’t guarantee privacy, we can’t release videos at all.</p>
<p>Some events add a disclaimers such as “if you don’t want to appear
in a recording, leave your video off and don’t say anything”.  We
would prefer not to do this, since:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>we <em>know</em> accidents happen (especially when coming back from breakout rooms)</p></li>
<li><p>it creates an incentive to not interact by voice/video</p></li>
<li><p>it could pressure participants to not object in order “to not be difficult”</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Livestreaming solves this for us</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>By separating the instruction from
the audience audio/video, there is no privacy risk in the raw
recording.  They could be released or shared unprocessed.</p></li>
<li><p>Recording with Zoom in a large meeting with all the instructors and
learners is simple, but not good for privacy: there are always
mistakes, reviewing takes too long.</p></li>
<li><p>Livestream platforms also provide instant recordings of the whole
stream, and some make instant replays possible.  This could remove
the need for making our own videos, since one of the most important
cases is this instant replay idea.</p></li>

<p>First off, install Whisper and generate the base subtitles, based
on the.  Since this is probably too much to expect for a short
lesson, they are provided for you (above), but if you want you can
try using Whisper, or generating the subtitles some other way.</p>
<p>You can start generating subtitles now, while you do the next
steps, so that they are ready by the time you are ready to apply
the editlist.  ffmpeg-editlist can also slice up the subtitles from
the main video to make subtitles for each segment you cut out.</p>
<p>Whisper is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>Organizing a course is time intensive and so is developing a course.  Many
courses given in country A are also relevant in other countries and instead of
developing and possibly re-inventing courses independently in different places,
it is so much more rewarding to collaborate and share.</p>
<p>In our courses we wish and try to make it easier for teams and organizations
and universities to join, at little risk and cost to them, possibly for a short
period of time, possibly only as observer. Later observers can progress to
exercise leads, expert helpers, instructors, and co-organizers.</p>
<p>One model that we have successfully tried is that the course is delivered via
live-stream to all partners and all the partner needs to do is to reserve a
room and motivate few people to help local learners as exercise leads during
exercise sessions which can happen in-person.</p>

<p>We usually say so much about the value of collaboration.  Despite us

kick that reduced our barriers and led to lasting changes in how we
taught (eventually leading to this very course).</p>
<p>Open Science / FAIR data is heavily emphazised these days.  But let’s
add a “C” to FAIR: “collaborative”.  Instead of people doing their own

<section id="version-control-and-static-site-generators">
<h4>Version control and static site generators<a class="headerlink" href="#version-control-and-static-site-generators" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>CodeRefinery and the Carpentries use git and Github to develop
lessons.  The general procedure is this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Version control to store the raw files in text format</p></li>
<li><p>A static website compiler to convert them to HTML files</p></li>
<li><p>Serving to the public via Github Pages (but this could be replaced
with other systems)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This allows for true collaborative development and community
contributions.</p>
<p>Carpentries uses a custom website complierer based on R, CodeRefinery
uses the Sphinx documentation engine which is used in many different
projects for documentation.  CodeRefinery’s use of a standard tool
allows us to build on a huge and growing ecosystem of extensions and
themes, and promotes local reuse.</p>
<p>The exact static website generator used isn’t so important, as long as
some form of version control is used.</p>
<p>A open-source license is the last bit to consider: without a license,
it can’t be reused and passed on, and there is little incentive for
someone to contribute.</p>

<p>It happens far too often: someone creates a lesson, but they think
about what is interesting to them, not what is important for the
learners.  In fact, an earlier version of this instructor training had
this very issue.</p>
<p>It is critical to backwards design almost any piece of communication,
especially something as widespread as teaching.</p>
<section id="the-approach">
<h4>The approach<a class="headerlink" href="#the-approach" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You don’t think about how to do something and try to explain it.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid the typical approach <em>“I want to show a number of things which I think are cool about
tool X - how do I press these into 90 minutes?”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Instead, you start defining your target audience by answering to questions
such <strong>What is the expected educational level of my audience?</strong>, <strong>Have they
been already exposed to the technologies I am planning to teach?</strong>, <strong>What
tools do they already use?</strong>, <strong>What are the main issues they are currently
experiencing?</strong>. It is important to discuss these points with a group of
colleagues, preferably from diverse backgrounds and institutions to reduce
biases. Once you clarified your target audience, it is useful to create
<strong>learner personas</strong>; that will help you during the development process by
providing concrete examples of potential learners showing up at your
workshops. For each <strong>learner personas</strong>, try to think of what is <strong>useful to
them</strong>: <em>“What do they <strong>need</strong> to
<a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/instructor-training/03-teaching-style/#using-bloom-s-taxonomy-to-write-effective-learning-objectives">remember/understand/apply/analyze/evaluate/create</a>?”</em>.
Asking and answering to these questions will allow you to define the
background knowledge (starting points) and goals (end points) of your
learners.  Then, you create a sequence of exercises which test incrementally
progressing tasks and acquisition of the new skills (from starting to end
points).</p></li>
<li><p>Then, you write the minimum amount
of material to teach the gap between exercises.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="admonition-title">Example: designing an HPC Carpentry lesson</p>
<p>Let’s take as an example the <em><a class="reference external" href="https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-intro/">HPC Carpentry lesson</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Target audience</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the expected educational level of my audience?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A PhD student, postdoc or young researcher.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Have they been already exposed to the technologies I am planning to teach?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The word <strong>HPC</strong> is not new to them and they may have already used an HPC but are still not capable of giving a proper definition of HPC. In addition, we do not expect them to know much about parallelism and they cannot make any distinction between various available parallelism paradigms.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What tools do they already use?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>serial codes, multi-threaded codes, data parallelism; usually out-of-the-box tools.</p></li>
<li><p>they may have tried to “scale” their code (multiprocessing, threading, GPUs) with more or less success.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What are the main issues they are currently experiencing?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>they cannot solve their problems either because they would like to run the same code but with many different datasets or because their problem is larger (more computations/memory).</p></li>
<li><p>most of the time they know their codes can run on HPC (from the documentation) but never really had the opportunity to try it out.</p></li>
<li><p>Very few will have their own codes where they may have tried different things to speed it up (threading, task parallelism) but have no clear strategy.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Learner persona</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sonya is a 1st year PhD student: she recently moved to Oslo and joined the
Computational and Systems Neuroscience group. She will be using the
<a class="reference external" href="https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/">NEST</a>, a simulator for spiking
neural network model. She used NEST during her master thesis but on her
small cluster: <strong>she never used an HPC resource</strong> and is really excited about it.</p></li>
<li><p>Robert is a field ecologist who obtained his PhD 6 months ago. He is now
working on a new project with Climate scientists and as a consequence will
need to run global climate models. He is <strong>not very familiar with command
line</strong> even though he attended a Software Carpentry workshop and the idea to
use HPC is a bit terrifying. He knows that he will get support from his
team who has extensive experience with HPC but would like to become more
independent and be able to <strong>run his own simulations</strong> (rather than copying
existing cases).</p></li>
<li><p>Jessica is a postdoc working on a project that investigates numerically the
complex dynamics arising at the tip of a fluid-driven rupture. Fluid
dynamics will be computed by a finite element method solving the
compressible Navier-Stokes equations on a moving mesh. She <strong>uses a code she
has developed</strong> during her PhD and that is based on existing libraries. She
has mostly ran it on a local desktop; her work during her PhD was very
limited due to the lack of computing resources and she is now very keen is
<strong>moving to HPC</strong>; she knows that it will requires some work, in particular to
parallelize her code. This HPC training will be her first experience with
HPC.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Learning outcomes</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Understand the difference between HPCs and other local/remote machines</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the notion of core, nodes, cluster, shared/distributed memory, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the notion of login nodes.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the need for a scheduler and how to use it appropriately</p></li>
<li><p>Understand why optimising I/O is important on HPC and how to best use HPC filesystems</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the need to parallelize (or use existing parallel) codes and in which cases HPCs is a must (when communications is required)</p></li>
<li><p>Understand how to get your code ready to use on HPC (access to libraries, installation of your own libraries/software, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Understand that an HPC is an operational machine and is not meant for developing codes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercises</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Get basic information such the number of CPUs, memory from your laptop and try to do the same on a HPC. Discuss outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to create files on the different filesystems on your HPC resource and access them.</p></li>
<li><p>Create different types of job scripts, submit and check outputs.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a concrete example to run a specific software on your HPC (something like GROMACS).</p></li>

<p class="admonition-title">Anne Fouilloux</p>
<p>I regularly teach Carpentries workshops so I try to apply what I have learnt to CodeRefinery workshops. However, I know our target audience is very much different and that I need to adapt my teaching style. I am still trying to find what works best in which situations and this is why I like so much CodeRefinery workshops. We usually have a wider range of skills and very mixed backgrounds so we usually have to be more careful with the pace and time given for exercises.</p>
<p>Some considerations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I spend quite a lot of time reading the CodeRefinery material and practising myself exercises. I particularly like to read the instructor notes just before teaching: they usually highlight important aspects both for preparing and teaching.</p></li>
<li><p>I usually do not show too much in advance the material as I think it prevents asking questions. If you have less competent practitioners in the classroom, they can easily copy-paste to avoid slowing down the entire classroom.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally, I’d like to give several exercises so anyone can work at its own pace. I find it is important that everybody gets something different from the workshop.</p></li>
<li><p>I love breaks as it gives us an opportunity to discuss with attendees on their research topics. I am especially interested to understand what software they write and how they plan to use what they learn during our workshops.</p></li>

<div class="admonition-bjorn-lindi exercise important admonition" id="exercise-2">
<p class="admonition-title">Bjørn Lindi</p>
<p>My teaching style has changed a bit since I started with CodeRefinery. In the beginning I had this “BLOB” (Binary Large OBject) of knowledge and experience that I wanted to to convey to the participants. With experience and some help from the Carpentries Instructor training, I have realized I need to serialize the “BLOB”, to be able to share it with others.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion as you would do with a binary large object which you intend to send over the wire, you will need stop signals, check-sums and re-transmissions, when you give a lecture. I have come to appreciate the natural periods/breaks the lessons offers, the questions raised, the errors that appear during type-along and the re-transmission. Co-instructors are good to use for re-transmission or broadening a specific topic.</p>
<p>When I started with CodeRefinery my inclination was to give a lecture. Today I am trying to be a guide during a learning experience, a learning experience which includes me as well. That may sound a bit self-centric, but is in fact the opposite, as I have to be more sensitive to what is going on in the room. The more conscious I am of being a guide, the better lesson.</p>
<p>Tools that I find useful in preparing a lesson is concept maps and Learner Personas, though I have develop to few them.</p>

<p>I never want to leave any learner behind and I really don’t like seeing confused, blank faces in the classroom.
At the same time I sometimes worry about some participants getting bored if a lesson is progressing slowly.
This is always a difficult compromise and something I struggle with!</p>
<p>I try to focus on making concepts intuitive, to “make sense” to the learners. Of course this is usually
based on how I learned the topic myself and how it makes sense to me.</p>
<p>I try to establish connections between topics: “this thing here is similar to what we saw in the previous
lesson where we learned about X…”.</p>
<p>Before mastering a lesson by teaching in many times I try to “follow the script”. After becoming very
familiar with a lesson I start to improvise more and react more dynamically to questions, e.g. by taking a
detour to explain a confusing topic more clearly.</p>
<p>What I think I do too often: copy-paste code/text from lesson material. This can leave learners behind -
typing out the code and describing it is slower, but more learning takes place. More advanced learners
will hopefully “be compensated” by interesting advanced exercises which follow.</p>

<div class="admonition-stefan-negru exercise important admonition" id="exercise-4">
<p class="admonition-title">Stefan Negru</p>
<p>A lesson is a conversation, it is useful if both the trainer and the trainee are engaged.
For that reason I try to have, most of the time, a conversation with the classroom and
after we finish parts of a lesson, step back and see how we might use what we learned.</p>
<p>That brings me to another point I follow throughout the lessons, answering questions like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How can we apply in practice what we just learned?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you see yourself (the trainee) using that in practice, why or why not?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the times those seem like open-ended questions to the trainees that just learned
something new, so I try to find examples, most of the times from personal experience.</p>
<p>Last thing is that analogies are important when I teach, I try to find analogies in order
to simplify a convoluted part of a lesson.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-radovan-bast exercise important admonition" id="exercise-5">
<p class="admonition-title">Radovan Bast</p>
<p>My teaching changed by 180 degrees after taking the Carpentries instructor
training.  Before that I used slides, 45 minute lecture blocks, and separate
exercise sessions.  After the Carpentries instructor training I embraced the
interaction, exercises, demos, and typos.</p>
<p>My goal for a lesson is to spark curiosity to try things after the lesson,
both for the novices (“This looks like a useful tool, I want to try using it
after the workshop.”) and the more experienced participants (“Aha - I did not
know you could do this. I wonder whether I can make it work with X.”). I like
to start lessons with a question because this makes participants look up from
their browsers.</p>
<p>Keeping both the novices and the experts engaged during a lesson can be
difficult and offering additional exercises seems to be a good compromise.</p>
<p>For me it is a good sign if there are many questions. I like to encourage
questions by asking questions to the participants. But I also try not to go
into a rabbit hole when I get a question where only experts will appreciate
the answer.</p>
<p>I try to avoid jargon and “war stories” from the professional developers’
perspective or the business world. Most researchers may not relate to them.
For examples I always try to use the research context. Avoid “customer”,
“production”, also a lot of Agile jargon is hard to relate to.</p>
<p>Less and clear is better than more and unclear. Simple examples are better
than complicated examples. Almost never I have felt or got the feedback that
something was too simple. I am repeating in my head to not use the words
“simply”, “just”, “easy”. If participants take home one or two points from
a lesson, that’s for me success.</p>
<p>I prepare for the lesson by reading the instructor guide and all issues and
open pull requests. I might not be able to solve issues, but I don’t want to
be surprised by known issues.  I learn the material to a point where I know
precisely what comes next and am never surprised by the next episode or
slide. This allows me to skip and distill the essence and not read bullet
point by bullet point.</p>
<p>I try to never deviate from the script and if I do, be very explicit about
it.</p>
<p>A great exercise I can recommend is to watch a tutorial on a new programming
language/tool you have never used. It can feel very overwhelming and fast to
get all these new concepts and tools thrown at self. This can prepare me for
how a participant might feel.</p>
<p>I find it very helpful if there is somebody else in the room who helps me
detecting when I go too fast or become too confusing. I like when two
instructors complement each other during a lesson but when doing that to
others, I am often worried of interrupting their flow and timing too much.</p>
<p>A mistake I often do is to type too fast and in my mind I force myself
to slow down.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-sabry-razick exercise important admonition" id="exercise-6">
<p class="admonition-title">Sabry Razick</p>
<p>My approach is to show it is fun to demystify concepts. Once a concept is
not a mystery anymore, the learners will understand  is what it means, where
it is coming from, why it is in place  and what it could it offer for their future.
I try to relate concepts to real life with a twist of humour whenever possible if
the outcome is certain not be offensive to any one. I use diagrams whenever possible,
I have spent weeks creating diagrams that is sometime three or four sentences. That
effort I consider  worthwhile as my intention is not to teach, but to demystify.
Once that is achieved, learners will learn the nitty gritty on their own easily
and with confidence, when they have the use-case.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Juho Lehtonen</p>
<p>I’m gradually realising the different ways to get a hint whether the workshop
participants are still following or perhaps bored. I assume it’s communicating
with the class, with exercises and simply by asking now and then. I also try
to remember to observe how people look like (puzzled, bored) while I teach, not
so obvious for me.</p>
<p>I believe that learners communicating with each other, in addition to with
instructors and helpers, really helps them to understand things faster. (At least
it helps me). So I try to make sure that no one sits or works alone at the workshops.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Richard Darst</p>
<p>Like many people, I’ve often been teaching, but rarely a teacher.  I
tend to teach like I am doing an informal mentorship.
I’ve realized long ago that my most important lessons weren’t
learned in classes, but by a combination of seeing things done by
friends and independent study after that.  I’ve realized that
teaching (the things I teach) is trying to correct these differences
in backgrounds.</p>
<p>My main job is supporting computing infrastructure, so my teaching
is very grounded in real-world problems.  I’m often start at the
very basics, because this is what I see missing most often.</p>
<p>When teaching, I like lots of audience questions and don’t mind
going off-script a bit (even though I know it should be minimized).
I find that sufficient audience interest allows any lesson to be a
success - you don’t have to know everything perfectly, just show how
you’d approach a problem.</p>

<div class="admonition-joao-m-da-silva exercise important admonition" id="exercise-9">
<p class="admonition-title">João M. da Silva</p>
<p>I started giving technical trainings twenty years ago, and hence my perspective
is perhaps more inclined towards the development of hands-on abilities and
capability to solve problems, independently or in a team.</p>
<p>But the development of hands-on practical skills, requires some essential
knowledge about the domain and some willingness to try different approaches
in case one gets stuck. Some call this the “KSA approach”
(“Knowledge-Skills-Attitude). Hence, I
try to impart the essential knowledge (and where to find out more) at my
trainings. And to encourage and challenge students in order to make them
overcome their self-perceived limits (e.g. “I’m a Humanist, I can’t use
Python virtualenv”).</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to study more about the Cognitive aspects of learning over the years,
and I should find out the time to return to that. There’s very interesting
research in Problem Solving, with Learning being a important component in that domain.</p>
<p>Storytelling: humans are neurologically made for paying attention to good
stories, and that’s something that I try to put into account: to give
a lesson like it would be a relevant narrative for the students, one that they
could relate to and help them in their work</p>
<p>I like to draw and be creative with that, but have to pay attention to
my handwriting during my trainings. I reckon that Architectural diagrams
help students to understand the big picture, so I should invest more on
those when development training material. I would also like to start looking into
Concept Maps and Semantic Trees in training.</p>

<p>Feedback is an essential part of effective learning. Feedback is bi-directional:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>To be effective, instructors need feedback on their learners’ progress. Learners can also check their progress and ask relevant questions to get clarification.</p></li>

<h5>Getting/giving feedback on learners’ progress<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-giving-feedback-on-learners-progress" title="Link to this heading"></a></h5>
<p>This feedback comes through what is called <em>formative assessments</em> (in contrast
to <em>summative assessment</em>).</p>
<div class="admonition-summative-assessment callout admonition" id="callout-1">
<p class="admonition-title">Summative Assessment</p>
<p><em>Summative assessment</em> is used
to judge whether a learner has reached an acceptable level of competence.
Usually at the end of a course
Learners either “pass” or “fail” a summative assessment.
One example is a driving exam,
which tells the rest of society whether someone can safely be allowed on the road. Most assessment done in university
courses is summative, and is used to assign course grades.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-formative-assessment callout admonition" id="callout-2">
<p class="admonition-title">Formative assessment</p>
<p><em>Formative assessment</em> takes place during teaching and learning. It sounds like
a fancy term, but it can be used to describe any interaction or activity
that provides feedback to both instructors and learners about learners’ level of understanding of the
material. For learners, this feedback can help focus their study efforts. For instructors, it allows them to refocus
their instruction to respond to challenges that learners are facing.
Used continuously</p>
</div>
<p>Learners don’t “pass” or “fail” formative assessments; they are simply a feedback mechanism.
For example, a music teacher might ask a learner to play a scale very slowly
in order to see whether they are breathing correctly,
and if not, what they should change.</p>
<p>Formative assessment is most useful when it happens frequently (we’ll talk about how frequently later)
and when the results are easily interpretable by the learner and instructor.</p>
<p>CodeRefinery uses different instruments to get feedback from learners:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Surveys: we will discuss about CodeRefinery pre/post-surveys in the episode
<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-workshops-online"><span class="doc">Running a workshop: online</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Exercises: we have many exercises during CodeRefinery workshops and use polls too but not necessarily many multiple-choice questions.
This is something that we may change in the future but the initial reason was that we build on existing knowledge
(see below section on our target audience) and give recommendations for best software practices:
there is no unique solution and you would like our learners to choose the approach that is most suitable for them.
For the same reasons, we have many optional exercises to accommodate the different levels.
We would like everyone to get something useful out of the CodeRefinery workshops.</p></li>

<p>Teaching is a skill. One of the objective of the CodeRefinery Instructor training is to give you
the confidence in teaching CodeRefinery lessons. Later we will have group work where we will

<p>Before doing so, we will learn here to give feedback on teaching using the same

As a group, we will watch <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApVt04rB4U">this video of teaching</a> and
give feedback on two axes: positive vs. negative and content vs. presentation. Have each person in
the class add one point to a 2x2 grid on a whiteboard or in the shared notes  (hackMD, etherpad, google doc) without duplicating any points.
For online instructor training event, use breakout room (4-5 persons per group) to facilitate discussion. Then each group reports to the shared notes.

<h4>Who are the learners<a class="headerlink" href="#who-are-the-learners" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The first task in teaching is to figure out who your learners are. The Carpentries approach is
based on the work of researchers like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Benner">Patricia Benner</a>,
who applied the
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition">Dreyfus model of skill acquisition</a>

This work indicates that through practice and formal instruction, learners acquire skills and advance
through distinct stages. In simplified form, the three stages of this model are:</p>

they don’t yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or how they relate.
One sign that someone is a novice is that their questions “aren’t even wrong”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Example: A <em>novice</em> learner in a Carpentries workshop might never have heard of the bash
shell, and therefore may have no understanding of how it relates to their file system or
other programs on their computer.</p></li>
<li><p>Example HPC: A learner who has never executed a program on remote computer in headless mode</p></li>
<li><p>Example HPC: A learner who has no understanding about using a queue system and having a
hard time why a program can not be run directly after login in.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Competent practitioner</em>: someone who has enough understanding for everyday purposes.
They won’t know all the details of how something works and their understanding may not
be entirely accurate, but it is sufficient for completing normal  tasks with normal
effort under normal circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Example: A <em>competent practitioner</em> in a Carpentries workshop might have used the shell
before and understand how to  move around directories and use individual programs, but
they might not understand how they can fit these programs together to build scripts
and automate large tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>Example: A <em>competent practitioner</em> in a CodeRefinery workshop is someone that understands
the concepts of best software practices and its importance. He/she clearly sees the
benefits of applying best software practices but he/she does not fully know yet how and
what to use for their own projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Example HPC: Knows how to establish a connection to a cluster and have submitted jobs.
But may not know how to request optimal amount of resources in a job and how to setup
parallel jobs</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Expert</em>: someone who can easily handle situations that are out of the ordinary.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Example: An <em>expert</em> in a Carpentries workshop may have experience writing and running shell
scripts and, when presented with a problem, immediately sees how these skills can be used
to solve the problem.</p></li>

and understand how to interpret error reports when something goes wrong and knows how to

<section id="cognitive-development-and-mental-models">
<h5>Cognitive Development and Mental Models<a class="headerlink" href="#cognitive-development-and-mental-models" title="Link to this heading"></a></h5>
<p>Effective learning is facilitated by the creation of a well-founded mental model. A mental model
is a collection of concepts and facts, along with the relationships between those concepts, which
a person has about a topic. For example, a long-time resident of the United States may have an
advanced understanding of the location of US states, major cities and landmarks, weather patterns,
regional economies and demographic patterns, as well as the relationships among these, compared
with their understanding of these relationships for other countries. In other words, their mental
model of the United States is more complex compared with their mental model of other countries.</p>
<p>We can distinguish between a <em>novice</em> and a <em>competent practitioner</em> for a given domain based
on the complexity of their mental models.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A <em>novice</em> is someone who has not yet built a mental model of the domain.
They therefore reason by analogy and guesswork, borrowing bits and pieces
of their mental models of other domains  which seem superficially similar.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>competent practitioner</em> is someone who has a mental model that’s good enough
for everyday purposes. This model does not have to be completely accurate in order
to be useful: for example, the average driver’s mental model of how a car works
probably doesn’t include most of the complexities that a mechanical engineer
would be concerned with.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We could expect a mixture of learners from <em>novice</em> and <em>competent practitioner</em> groups
in HPC training events.</p>

<section id="how-knowledge-gets-in-the-way">
<h5>How “knowledge” gets in the way<a class="headerlink" href="#how-knowledge-gets-in-the-way" title="Link to this heading"></a></h5>
<p>Mental models are hardly ever built from scratch. Every learner comes to a topic with
some amount of information, ideas and opinions about the topic. This is true even in
the case where a learner can’t articulate their prior knowledge and beliefs.</p>
<p>In many cases, this prior knowledge is incomplete or inaccurate. Inaccurate beliefs
can be termed “misconceptions” and can impede learning by making it more difficult for
learners to incorporate new, correct information into their mental models.
Correcting learners’ misconceptions is at least as important as presenting them with
correct information. Broadly speaking, misconceptions fall into three categories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Simple factual errors</strong>, such as believing that Vancouver is the capital of
British Columbia. These are the easiest to correct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Broken models</strong>, such as believing that motion and acceleration must be in the
same direction. We can address these by having learners reason through examples to
see contradictions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fundamental beliefs</strong>, such as “the world is only a few thousand years old” or
“human beings cannot affect the planet’s climate”. These beliefs are deeply connected
to the learner’s social identity and are the hardest to change.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The current HPC carpentry workshop material are aimed at <strong>Novice</strong> of HPC</p>
<p>Among  <em>Novice</em>  learners there might be learners who are experts in their domain and very
competent in the program they are executing, but may not have used a HPC system before.
Then among the  <strong>competent practitioners</strong> There might be learners who repeat some procedures
they have inherited but lack a in-depth understanding of what’s going on. That is why it is
important to get accurate feedback, before and during the workshops to understand the learner profiles.</p>

<h5>Working with learning objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-learning-objectives" title="Link to this heading"></a></h5>
<p>Each CodeRefinery lesson (also the HPC capentries lessons) usually has a <em>learning objectives</em> section.
Good learning objectives are quite specific about the intended effect of a lesson on its learners.
We aim to create learning objectives that are specific, accurate, and informative for
both learners and instructors.</p>

<h5>Using Bloom’s Taxonomy to write effective learning objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#using-bloom-s-taxonomy-to-write-effective-learning-objectives" title="Link to this heading"></a></h5>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/">Bloom’s Taxonomy</a> is a framework for thinking about learning that breaks progress down into discrete, hierarchical steps.
While many ideas have come and gone in education, Bloom’s has remained a useful tool for educators, in particular because the
hierarchy seems to be reasonably valid: outcomes at the top of the hierarchy cannot be achieved without mastery of outcomes at
the bottom. In the long term, everybody wants to be at the top. However, in aiming to meet learners where they are, we also
need to be mindful about helping them to <a class="reference external" href="https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/03/tractenberg-summary.html">“grow a level,”</a> helping them to recognize when they have achieved that growth, and
guiding them to look ahead to where we might not be able to take them.</p>

<h5>Revisiting Learning objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#revisiting-learning-objectives" title="Link to this heading"></a></h5>
<p>When using existing teaching material, <em>reverse instructional design</em>  principles might be applied as
follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Review the lesson’s learning objectives carefully, thinking about how they will work for your audience</p></li>
<li><p>Scan the lesson to identify promising points to check in with your learners, using formative assessment to verify that objectives have been met</p></li>
<li><p>Review the connecting content in detail to be sure everything works and you have anticipated likely problems and questions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We strongly encourage you to read them before teaching a lesson and to review whether they still match the content of the lesson:</p>

<li><p>Questions are great, and important for any practical and interactive
class</p></li>

<li><p>CodeRefinery strategy: HackMD for questions</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chat is not good enough, you can’t reply to old things</p></li>
<li><p>HackMD allows threaded replies and follow up later</p></li>
<li><p>You need some other helpers to watch HackMD and answer, and bring
things up to you.  And let you know how things are going.</p></li>
<li><p>Learners can ask anonymously</p></li>
<li><p>Learners don’t have to worry about interrupting the flow.</p></li>
<li><p>Disadvantage: can produce information overload, warn people to not
follow too closely</p></li>
<li><p>With too few people, it can turn out to be very quiet.</p></li>

<p>Goals of the teaching practice:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In groups of 4-5 persons we will practice teaching a <strong>5-minute segment
of a lesson of your choice</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The section you pick should require <strong>screen sharing</strong> and be of some
<strong>demonstration or follow-along task</strong> (preferably using a shell) to also
practice having a good screen-sharing setup.</p></li>
<li><p>We will practice giving <strong>constructive feedback</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>We will practice improving our 5-minute segment by taking the feedback into account.</p></li>
<li><p>In both session you can teach the same topic/segment but if you prefer you can also
change the topic/aspect for the second session.</p></li>
