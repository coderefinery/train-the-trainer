## Welcome

## CodeRefinery goals

### Carpentries membership

## Carpentries approach to teaching

We will give you a short overview of the Carpentries approach to teaching and highlight parts that are most important for teaching CodeRefinery lessons.

## CodeRefinery training philosophies

Here CodeRefinery instructors share their training philosophy. The main goal is to show that we all have different teaching styles and how these differences are beneficial to CodeRefinery workshops.

It is important to explain how much we value individuals and that there is not one way to teach but as many ways as individuals. The goal is to help each others to find the way that is best for each of us.

## CodeRefinery lessons and workshop


### What is a CodeRefinery workshop?

In this section, we explain briefly what is a CodeRefinery workshop and in particular how much we can mix and match lessons for new workshops.

Practical information on how to organize a workshop will be given later.

### Lightning overview of all lessons 

Details on lessons will be given later, so here we mostly give a very short overview of each CodeRefinery lesson.
