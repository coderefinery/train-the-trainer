## Sustainability beyond 2021

### Funding

In October 2018 CodeRefinery entered the second phase of the project, with funding from [NeIC](https://neic.no)
until autumn 2021. A key objective for CodeRefinery 2.0 is to **render the project largely self-sustained after
October 2021**.

Public documents relating to the management of the CodeRefinery project,
including project directive and project plan, are available on the
[NeIC website](https://neic.no/coderefinery/).


### Vision: institutional partnerships

- After phase 2, travel and accommodation for workshops will be financed by the hosting
  institution, similarly to the Carpentries model.
- The lesson material will be maintained by the community, volunteers, and in-kind staff time.
- Employers will be encouraged to allow instructors across Nordics to participate in-kind in 1-2 workshops/year.
- A completely self-financed organization may not be realistic, but we aim to arrive at
  a project which can continue using 0.5-1 FTE/year for coordination.
- [Training hubs](https://coderefinery.org/about/hubs/) offering recurring workshops (1-2 workshops/ year).

Reaching this goal will depend on **developing institutional recognition** for the project.
But how do we get there?


### Building a community

Building a community will be another essential requirement to reach sustainability.

Several avenues should be pursued:

- Train-the-trainer program
  - Promote, train, and certify future trainers at annual train-the-trainer workshops
- Symbiosis with The Carpentries and PRACE advanced training centers
  - CodeRefinery can be positioned as the second step after attending a Carpentry workshop
  - Coordinating with PRACE advanced training centers, embed CodeRefinery workshops within PRACE?
- Symbiosis with local units
  - Partner with universities to bring workshops to their community as a default service
  - Aalto Science IT to serve as perfect model
- [Research software engineer (RSE) community in the Nordics](http://nordic-rse.org/)
  - CodeRefinery can serve as a hub
  - Bi-annual or annual conferences, inspired by [UK-RSE](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2019/)

## How to get involved

There are many ways to get involved: <https://coderefinery.org/get-involved/>

- Become a workshop helper
- Become a CodeRefinery workshop instructor
- Become a Carpentries workshop instructor
- Contribute to teaching material: <https://github.com/coderefinery>
- Create your own teaching material in our constellation of teaching.
- Reuse our material
- Become an institutional partner as a training hub
- Participate in our chat and shape the project and lessons with us: <https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com>
- Start a study group

## How to run own workshops

- We recommend the following lessons as core CodeRefinery workshop with the following lesson-order:
  Introduction to Git, collaborative Git, reproducible research and FAIR data,
  social coding and open software, documentation, Jupyter, automated testing, modular code development.
- But no problem to distribute these over several days or weeks.
- Do not hesitate to reach out if you need support or mentoring when starting a workshop.

## Certification for CodeRefinery instructors

We will set up a more formal process soon but for now you would need to:

- Attend an instructor training (this workshop).
- Contribute to a lesson, either via pull request, issue, discussion, or as a helper.
- Share a short teaching demo or teach a lesson at a CodeRefinery workshop where you will get some feedback on your teaching.
- Participate in a call with other instructors and helpers either preparing a workshop or during a workshop debrief session.

There are many ways to learn how to teach well.  We and carpentries provide one way and basic material, but we want to find a way for everyone to be a part of us.

## Skills maps: what is our big picture?

CodeRefinery doesn't exist in isolation: we have non-academic skills
that need to be taught at all different levels.

- We need more than just CodeRefinery: we need a network of courses, with
  - clear prerequisites
  - clear audience and purpose
  - developed with hands-on style

We want to develop a *galaxy* of different courses, all working together and findable:
- Can this instructor training inspire you to make your own good courses?
- Our attempt to organize the world is [Hands-on Scientific Computing](https://handsonscicomp.readthedocs.io/)

## Partnerships and community

Teaching can't be done in isolation, we need to organize the whole computing community together:

We are making good progress in nordics:
- CodeRefinery, Carpentries, etc: basic teaching
- Infrastructures: work to make things more accessible, take part in
  teaching, improve teaching and docs quality
  [NordicHPC](https://nordichpc.github.io/)
- Research software engineers for hands-on support
