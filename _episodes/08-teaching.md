# CodeRefinery lessons

We will now split into groups and study, teach and discuss the
CodeRefinery lessons. Each participant will join one group in each
of the three sessions.

> ## Bad and good live coding examples
>
> Teaching by live coding is a
> [performance art which requires practice](https://teachtogether.tech/#s:performance-exercises).
> This exercise highlights some typical pitfalls that most instructors
> fall into sooner or later, and also shows how to avoid them.
> Watch closely since we will be giving feedback!
> - Watch first [this video](https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE)
> - Then watch [this video](https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY)
> - How is the second round of teaching better than the first?
> - Is there anything that was better in the first than in the second?
> - Please give feedback in the shared workshop document.

## Lesson discussions

- Each group will have a CodeRefinery instructor who will introduce
  the lesson and guide the discussions.
- Discussions may lead to suggestions for improvements in either lessons
  or lesson instructor guides. These should be recorded as issues to
  lesson repositories.
- The format will be flexible and should be adapted to the specifics of
  each lesson, but a starting point can be:
  1. The instructor gives a high-level overview of the lesson and
     reviews the instructor guide.
  2. Discussion of the intended learning outcomes and lesson episode structure.
  3. Episodes are distributed between subgroups (2-4 people), who study the
     material.
  4. Within subgroups, participants study the episode, discuss it, and (if
     relevant) take turns to present and live-code selected parts for 3-5
     minutes. The other subgroup participants give feedback.
  5. Subgroups present thoughts and conclusions to the whole group.
  6. Steps 3-5 are repeated with a different distribution of episodes if
     time allows.
  7. Instructor guide is again reviewed based on the discussions and
     improvements are made directly or via issues.
- You can refer to the [lesson review
  guide](https://github.com/coderefinery/manuals/blob/master/lesson-review.md)
  and the [lesson design
  guide](https://github.com/coderefinery/manuals/blob/master/lesson-design.md)
  for checklists for key points.

### Exercises

Each group should engage in exercises to practice teaching or think more
deeply about the material, but not all exercises are equally suitable to
each lesson. Here are a few exercises that can be used for each lesson.

> ## Learning objectives
>
> - Give feedback on the presented learning objectives on two axes:
>   positive vs. negative and content vs. presentation.
> - Discuss the learning objectives and how they fit to CodeRefinery objectives
>   that are to improve researcher's best software practices.
>
{: .challenge}

> ## Create a concept map
>
> - Choose an episode/part of the lesson you are working on and study it.
> - Create a *concept map* of the episode, where facts are represented as
>   bubbles and lines between the bubbles denote their connections.
{: .challenge}

> ## Live coding practice
>
> - Choose an episode from the lesson you are working on, and think about how
>   you could teach it.
> - Teach it to your group members for 3-5 minutes using your laptop
>   (group members can sit next to the presenter).
>   See if you can practice the following skills:
>   - describing what you are doing while you type
>   - turning typos/mistakes into valuable learning experiences
> - After the demo, other group members give feedback on a 2x2 matrix, with
>   [content, presentation] on one axis and [positive, negative] on the other.
{: .challenge}

> ## Design a new exercise
>
> - Choose an episode/part of the lesson you are working on and study it.
> - Try to come up with an idea for a new exercise, and write it down.
> - Group members try out the new exercise and give feedback:
>   - was it too hard or too easy?
>   - does it relate to any intended learning outcomes for the lesson?
>   - does it expose any possible misconceptions that learners might have?
{: .challenge}

> ## Design formative assessment
>
> - Choose an episode/part of the lesson you are working on and study it.
> - Try to come up with a *formative assessment* question/problem for this episode.
> - The formative assessment should give feedback to both learners and
>   instructors on whether a topic is correctly understood or if
>   misconceptions remain.
{: .challenge}

> ## Modularity and reusability
>
> - How can we make this lesson more modular, without falling into the
>   framework trap (too general and not too good for anything)?
> - How could you re-use this lesson into a similar course you are
>   involved in?  What is missing in the lesson in order to motivate
>   you to do so? (or make it easy)
>

### Part 1 (90 min)

We begin by discussing these lessons:

- [Git intro](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/)
- [Modular code development](https://cicero.xyz/v3/remark/0.14.0/github.com/coderefinery/modular-code-development/master/talk.md)
- [Reproducible research](https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/)


> ## Summary and lessons learned
>
> Summarize your discussions together (all groups) and discuss how to
> improve the process for the next round of lesson discussions.
